# Repository Guidelines

## Governing Context Contract

This root `AGENTS.md` is the governing agent contract for this repository. Treat it as the first place to preserve durable repo-specific operating rules, not as a lightweight summary.

When the user corrects agent behavior in a way that should survive future sessions, update this file in the same work wave unless the rule is private, secret, temporary, or explicitly not meant for the repo. Do not rely on chat history, memory, or prior-run summaries for rules that should govern future agents.

Do not impose an arbitrary length cap on this file. In particular, do not trim it to fit a 300-line preference or a generic prompt-aesthetics target. If repo rules need more context, add the context here with clear headings and keep it operational.

Keep this file aligned with the repo's actual workflow. If a rule also belongs in installed Codex context for future converted repos, mirror the portable part into `ls/templates/codex/AGENTS.md`. If the rule is only for this checkout, keep it here.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository packages Localsetup, a repo-local framework for agent context, skills, and install workflows. Root files include the Bash installer (`install`), top-level docs, `VERSION`, and support files. The main engine lives in `ls/`: reusable code is under `ls/lib/`, OS discovery helpers under `ls/discovery/`, shipped skills under `ls/skills/`, platform templates under `ls/templates/`, and framework docs under `ls/docs/`. Tests live in `ls/tests/`; static assets live in `assets/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `uv sync --locked --all-groups`: sync the repo-local uv project environment from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
- `uv run --locked ./ls/tests/automated_test.sh`: run the core Linux/macOS smoke test suite.
- `workers="$(uv run --locked python ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . test-workers)" && uv run --locked pytest -n "$workers" ls/tests -q`: run the full Python pytest suite using Localsetup's hardened worker default. Use this as final consolidation verification for broad/shared changes, release or publish readiness, dependency changes, or explicit user requests, not as the first validation step for routine edits.
- `./install --directory . --tools codex --sync-env --non-interactive --yes`: test a local non-interactive install path for one platform and sync the uv environment.
- `uv run --locked python ls/tools/generate_docs_artifacts.py --repo-root .` and `uv run --locked python ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . generate-docs`: refresh generated docs artifacts when documentation inputs change.
- `uv run --locked python ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . publish-preflight --base <base-ref> --head HEAD`: check the publish-time version and generated-document state before pushing; add `--fix` only after feature/docs changes are committed and you want the tool to create the needed sync commits.
- `uv run --locked python ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . release-push`: compute the outgoing Conventional Commit version bump, sync versioned docs, create the release sync commit, and push.

## Command Choice Clarification

Python-first framework tooling does not mean using Python for every shell task. Use standard shell tools for normal inspection and file discovery, such as `rg`, `sed`, `find`, `wc`, and `git`. Use Python when running repo-native Python tools, testing Python code, or parsing structured data where a normal CLI tool is unavailable or less reliable.

Python architecture: new and substantially refactored Python tooling follows ls/docs/PYTHON_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARD.md; keep entrypoints thin, package responsibilities explicit, and existing debt baseline-managed.

## Sandboxed `uv` Cache

When running `uv` commands from an agent sandbox, first check whether the sandbox already allows writes to the user uv cache, normally `~/.cache/uv` or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv`. If the sandbox policy can be adjusted for the session or workspace, prefer adding that cache directory as a writable cache exception; it is host cache state, not repository content.

If the sandbox cannot be changed from the current agent session, do not let `uv` default to a read-only user-level cache. That causes avoidable `Could not acquire lock` or read-only filesystem failures before pytest starts. Use a repo-local ignored cache:

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR="$PWD/.localsetup-maint/state/uv-cache" uv run --locked pytest ls/tests -q
```

Use the same `UV_CACHE_DIR="$PWD/.localsetup-maint/state/uv-cache"` prefix for `uv run`, `uv sync`, and related validation commands unless the command intentionally needs the user cache. If the repo-local state path is unavailable, use a writable `/tmp` cache such as `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/localsetup-uv-cache`. Escalate for `uv` cache access only when using the real user cache is required or after trying a writable cache location and confirming the command still fails for a reason that requires approval.

## Single Checkout Development Boundary

Localsetup development is consolidated in this checkout. Do not create sibling clones, extra Git worktrees, release staging checkouts, PR-specific checkouts, or other repo-shaped directories for Localsetup work unless the user explicitly authorizes that specific path and purpose in the current task.

Work within the active repository by default. Use normal branches, local commits, stashes, ledgers, and tightly scoped subagent assignments inside this checkout instead of creating filesystem-level copies. Subagents may inspect and edit bounded paths in the active checkout; they do not need separate worktrees merely for isolation.

If a separate checkout or worktree is genuinely necessary, stop and explain why the active checkout cannot satisfy the requirement. Record the approved path, branch, reason, owner, expected lifetime, and cleanup command in the run ledger before creating it. Remove the temporary worktree with `git worktree remove` as soon as the approved purpose is complete.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Keep scripts portable and explicit: Bash files should use `set -euo pipefail`; PowerShell should prefer clear parameter names and non-interactive modes for automation. Python code uses 4-space indentation, standard-library path handling via `pathlib` where practical, and small helper functions in `ls/lib/`. Skill directories use `ls-<topic>` naming and each skill must include a spec-compatible `SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter. Markdown should use clear headings, relative links, and concise task-oriented language.

## Testing Guidelines

Add or update tests under `ls/tests/` for changes to path resolution, discovery, parsing, deploy behavior, or skill tooling. Name Python tests `test_<feature>.py` and keep shell wrappers thin. Before the full suite, run compliance and validation checks that match the code you changed, such as focused pytest files or test functions, `validate-catalog`, `validate-package-surface`, `doctor`, generated-doc drift checks, schema checks, and `git diff --check`.

Use the full Python suite as final consolidation verification for broad framework changes, shared runtime behavior, release/publish work, dependency changes, or explicit user requests. Compute the default worker count with `localsetup test-workers`, which uses `ceil(available CPU cores / 2)` clamped to `1..255`; override with `LOCALSETUP_TEST_WORKERS` or `localsetup test-workers --workers <n>` when needed. Do not run the full suite as the default first-pass validation for routine daily work; the codebase is large and full-suite runs have noticeable CPU cost. Windows support is WSL2-only in the current framework.

Test effort must be proportional to risk. For tiny docs, policy, metadata, or one-line behavior changes, prefer static checks such as `git diff --check`, targeted syntax checks, or no test run when there is no executable surface. Do not add broad or repetitive tests merely to increase evidence. Add tests only for behavior that can realistically regress, and keep test code smaller than the implementation unless the behavior is safety-critical or has multiple important edge cases. Run the smallest relevant validation first; broaden only after focused checks pass or when the affected surface justifies it.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use the existing Conventional Commit style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `ci:`, or `type!:` followed by a short imperative summary. Keep PRs focused, target `main`, describe what changed and why, link related issues, and include test results. For framework, skill, or workflow changes, include a brief rationale and note compatibility impact across supported agent platforms. Do not add AI tools or assistants as co-authors or contributors.

Before publishing a branch or opening/updating a PR, treat generated docs and version sync as part of the publish surface, not as volatile noise. Run `publish-preflight` locally against the intended base ref; if it creates sync commits, rerun the focused tests and push the final generated-doc refresh commit with the branch. Do not weaken generated-doc/version validators or ignore those paths merely to get past GitHub validation.

## Release Authority And Blockers

Do not invent a maintainer-approval requirement. Require GitHub approval only when a live ruleset, branch-protection rule, repository policy, or the user's current instruction requires it. A user request to publish authorizes the ordinary in-scope release actions named in the accepted plan; do not re-ask for each step.

If a real blocker needs a decision, state the issue briefly, recommend the best next action, and ask for one concise authorization. Offer alternatives only when they materially change risk or outcome.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit local secrets, generated private state, or machine-specific agent data. Treat imported third-party skills as untrusted until reviewed with the repository's safety and validation workflows. Keep version and generated documentation sync changes in the automatic release-sync commit generated by the repo tooling.

## Adapter Directory Ownership

Agent adapter directories, including `.codex/skills`, `.claude/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, `.kilo/skills`, `.openclaw/skills`, `.opencode/skills`, and historical `.agents/skills`, are not exclusive Localsetup-owned surfaces. Repositories may intentionally keep custom skills, symlinks, files, or mixed managed and repo-owned content in those paths.

Localsetup repair, migration, installer, and cleanup work must preserve custom adapter content in place by default. Do not move, rename, delete, or "normalize" repo-owned content out of an adapter-shaped directory merely because Localsetup also writes managed links there. A migration out of an adapter directory requires an explicit repo-owner decision and a preservation plan recorded in the run ledger.

When a Localsetup tool reports `adapter_content`, `adapter_collision`, or same-directory custom skills, treat that as a manual preservation decision, not permission to make the directory Localsetup-exclusive. Prefer a tool/code fix or a mixed-adapter preservation path over relocating user content.

## Public And Private Context Boundary

`ls/docs/`, root documentation, platform templates, generated docs, and package/catalog surfaces are publishable framework context. Do not place repo-maintenance plans, private audits, unapproved inventories, internal ledgers, or transient planning artifacts in those locations unless the user explicitly authorizes public documentation.

There are three separate destinations. Do not blur them:

- tracked and GitHub-visible: source, public framework docs, templates, tests, and examples intentionally meant for the public repo
- tracked but release-archive-excluded: rare repo metadata examples that are safe on GitHub but should not ship in framework archives, controlled by `.gitattributes export-ignore`
- local private and untracked: active maintenance state, run ledgers, private audit drafts, generated local indexes, credentials, logs, caches, and planning transcripts

Use private or ignored locations for repo-maintenance state:

- `.codex/runs/` for controller ledgers, resume notes, validation evidence, and temporary handoff prompts
- `.localsetup-maint/` for private maintenance plans, audit drafts, private inventories, and non-public working documents
- `.git/info/exclude` for repo-local ignore rules that should not affect collaborators

Before creating or moving planning material, classify the destination as public framework context or private maintenance state. If public placement is not explicitly authorized, keep the material private and record only a compact public pointer when the user asks for one.

Git hygiene defaults for this repo:

- Keep `.codex/runs/`, `.codex/sessions/`, `.codex/logs/`, `.codex/tmp/`, `.localsetup-maint/docs/`, `graphify-out/`, `state/`, `data/`, and root `docs/` out of normal commits.
- Use `.gitignore` for repo-wide private-state patterns. Use `.git/info/exclude` only for one-machine extras.
- Before committing or publishing, check `git status --short`, `git diff --cached --name-status`, and `git ls-files .codex/runs .localsetup-maint/docs graphify-out state data docs`.
- If a file must be tracked for local repository operation but should not ship in release archives, add an explicit `.gitattributes export-ignore` rule and state why in the commit.
- The pre-commit hook blocks staged private/local maintenance paths by default. Use `LOCALSETUP_ALLOW_PRIVATE_STAGE=1` only after an explicit public-boundary review.

## Volatile Fact Verification

Before editing or validating markdown claims about latest/current versions, release channels, rate cards, vendor behavior, APIs, protocols, external tool support, security advisories, package compatibility, or platform support, check `.localsetup-maint/docs/volatile-facts.yaml` if it exists.

If the volatile fact index is absent and a volatile claim is found or introduced, create it using the private repo schema. Keep `.localsetup-maint/docs/volatile-facts.yaml` private and untracked; do not move it into public framework docs.

Use source-code, config, and local CLI verification for Localsetup behavior claims. Use primary upstream research for external claims, such as official docs, release notes, package registries, standards, vendor API schemas, advisories, or live CLI/API behavior where safe. For broad or current external fact verification, use research agents and record source URLs, access dates, conflicts, and limitations in the volatile index.

Update the volatile fact index in the same work wave whenever a volatile claim is verified, corrected, de-volatilized, removed, or newly introduced.

## Agent-Team Workflow Defaults

For non-trivial development work, act as the controller and default to subagent-first execution. Optimize for task throughput by keeping each work unit small enough to verify, keeping the main context compact, and actively looking for useful read-only, research, implementation, validation, or review work to delegate. The controller owns requirements clarification, plan quality, task decomposition, delegation, state tracking, verification, and final acceptance. Use direct single-agent work only for trivial one-step tasks, simple questions, cases where no useful independent subtask exists, or active tool/mode constraints that prevent delegation.

Use agent-team mode by default for non-trivial work, especially when work may touch more than one or two files, the code path is unclear, the area is unfamiliar, validation is required, or the task involves architecture, migrations, auth, data flow, concurrency, security, external integrations, tests, current external facts, broad search, long logs, or likely compaction risk. Before doing substantial work directly, first identify whether at least one `explorer`, `researcher`, `worker`, `tester`, or `reviewer` assignment can reduce risk, preserve context, or improve verification.

Normal fanout is one or two agents for non-trivial tasks. Use three only when the scopes are clearly independent discovery, research, or validation tasks. Treat configured thread capacity as operational headroom, not a target. Explicit user instructions, tool restrictions, sandbox/approval policy, and active modes override delegation defaults.

Keep the existing native roles generic: `explorer` maps relevant files, systems, docs, workflows, data, dependencies, tests, and risks; `researcher` verifies current or source-backed facts; `worker` executes one bounded task with exact write scope; `tester` runs validations, benchmarks, measurements, and failure summaries; `reviewer` checks final risk, correctness, regression, scope, and evidence. The `guardian_subagent` role is reserved for approval and permission review, not normal task delegation.

For agent-team work, keep a repo-local ledger at `.codex/runs/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<task-slug>.md`. If `.codex/runs/` is not already excluded from Git, add it to `.git/info/exclude`, not `.gitignore`. In Plan Mode or other no-write contexts, plan the ledger and subtasks but do not create ledger files or edit state until writes are allowed. Record objective, phase, plan, subtasks, checkpoints, validation, decisions, resume notes, and final acceptance criteria. After interruption or compaction, read the ledger, run `git status --short`, inspect outstanding diffs, and resume from the first non-completed task whose dependencies are satisfied.

Only the controller may mark subtasks `verified` or `completed`. A subagent report is evidence, not completion. Claims such as complete, implemented, validated, reviewed, or ready require ledger checkpoints, inspected diffs, validation results, and final review evidence. If evidence is missing, say "Not confirmed yet." and continue the workflow.

Before spawning a subagent, write the task in the ledger with exact scope, what to inspect or change, what not to do, expected output, and validation commands. After a subagent returns, summarize the report in the ledger, verify the evidence directly, then update task status. A report alone is not a checkpoint.

For bounded autonomous maintenance loops, create or resume the private ledger first and preserve the existing dirty baseline. Select exactly one small slice at a time from, in order, an assigned queue or PRD, a failing validation or drift signal, a repo-contract gap, or narrow docs/tests/tooling upkeep. Do not mine broad TODOs or opportunistically expand scope. Use subagents when they reduce context load or enable safe parallel read-only work, but keep implementation to one bounded worker at a time. Validate proportionally, require review evidence before final acceptance, and do not push, deploy, schedule cron, run destructive commands, reshape adapters, run migrations, authenticate, install dependencies, or mutate external systems without explicit approval.

Before final response on non-trivial work, inspect `git status --short`, inspect the scoped diff, run or delegate required validation, resolve or document reviewer findings, and update the ledger with final evidence. Do not claim completion from memory.

## Skill And Context Preservation

When editing `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, workflow docs, examples, references, schemas, templates, or operational runbooks, preserve task capability over brevity.

Do not shorten files solely to satisfy model preference, prompt aesthetics, arbitrary line-count targets, or a generic desire to be concise. Long files are acceptable when they contain examples, command matrices, schemas, decision tables, safety constraints, edge cases, troubleshooting, or operational context that agents need to perform the task.

For large or mature skill/context files, prefer surgical edits. Whole-file rewrites require a preservation plan first.

Before materially reducing a skill or context file, identify the operational content that must survive:

- trigger cases and scope boundaries
- examples and worked flows
- command matrices and CLI contracts
- schemas, output shapes, and config formats
- safety constraints and approval gates
- edge cases and failure handling
- troubleshooting guidance
- external API, version, or product assumptions
- linked references, assets, templates, and scripts

After the edit, each item must be either preserved in place, moved to an appropriate `references/`, `assets/`, `templates/`, `schemas/`, or script file, or explicitly removed with controller-approved rationale.

A large line-count reduction is a review trigger, not a success metric. Any reduction of roughly 25 percent or more in a mature skill/context file requires before/after coverage notes in the run ledger and reviewer signoff.
