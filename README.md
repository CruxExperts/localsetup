**Version:** 4.3.3<br>

**Localsetup gives coding agents a repo-local operating layer.**

Agent work is moving from one-off prompts into repeatable development operations. The hard part is not only giving an agent more context; it is keeping that context durable, reviewable, portable across tools, and safe enough for real repositories.

Localsetup turns your repository into the source of truth for agent instructions, skills, workflow packages, adapter configuration, safety gates, install state, documentation truth, and release evidence. It is not another chat prompt collection. It is a portable framework with adapters for Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, OpenClaw, Kilo, and OpenCode, plus a disciplined package library and predictable controller workflow model.

Use it when you want agents to stop improvising from hidden local setup and start working from auditable context that travels with the code.

## The short version

Localsetup packages:

- Global framework source under `~/.local/share/localsetup/source` for installed users; source checkouts keep `ls/` for contributors
- 103 shipped capability skills plus 24 first-class workflow packages for debugging, testing, PR review, infrastructure, docs, git recovery, skill import, security vetting, context indexing, TypeScript code quality, opt-in harness automation, OmniRoute integration, and agent workflow control
- Cross-platform adapters for Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, OpenClaw, Kilo, and OpenCode
- Agent Skills-compatible `SKILL.md` packages that can be imported, normalized, vetted, installed, and reused
- Workflow packages under `ls/workflows/` that stay executable as skills while carrying Localsetup `workflow.yaml` metadata for aliases, gates, dependencies, and generated registries
- Documentation alignment tooling that inventories source-owned docs, maps code truth, audits generated facts, and refreshes supported public/generated surfaces
- Context-index tooling for vector-first SQLite retrieval, freshness checks, agent preflight, MCP configuration support, and machine-readable worklists
- A Python-first installer with preflight, planning, verification, rollback metadata, and generated docs sync
- Opt-in harness automation for Codex heartbeat and repo-finalizer workflows, plus human-in-the-loop operations for risky commands, remote/server work, and sudo-aware tmux sessions

That means your agent setup travels with the repo, survives context resets, and can be reviewed like code.

## How it fits together

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/localsetup-architecture.svg" alt="Localsetup architecture: repo source, config resolver, managed home library, adapters, and rollback metadata" width="960">
</p>

The registered Localsetup source checkout is the canonical framework source. The installer resolves configuration, creates the managed package library for skills and workflow packages, attaches only explicitly selected target adapter paths, writes target lock/report metadata under `.localsetup/`, and records an install journal under `.localsetup/install-journal/`. Consuming repos do not receive a copied `ls/` by default.

## Skills and workflow packages

Localsetup makes one important distinction explicit:

| Package type | Source root | Runtime shape | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capability skill | `ls/skills/ls-*` | Agent Skills `SKILL.md` package | A reusable capability such as debugging, testing, skill import, PR review, service triage, or versioning. |
| Workflow package | `ls/workflows/ls-workflow-*` | Agent Skills `SKILL.md` package plus `workflow.yaml` | A named orchestration flow with aliases, required skills, gates, phases, validation, and expected outputs. |

Both package types install into `~/.local/share/localsetup/packages`, so agent hosts can invoke them through explicitly attached adapter paths. The split keeps portable skills clean while making workflow orchestration auditable and generated from source manifests.

Start with the [workflow packages guide](ls/docs/WORKFLOW_PACKAGES.md) for usage and the [workflow standard](ls/docs/WORKFLOW_STANDARD.md) for authoring rules.

## 60-second quickstart

Global bootstrap from any directory on Linux, macOS, or WSL2:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CruxExperts/localsetup/main/install | bash -s --
```

This opens an interactive terminal wizard. The raw bootstrap wrapper checks the latest stable GitHub release, falls back to the latest stable-looking tag when the release API is unavailable, creates or refreshes the managed source checkout from that ref, explains what will be changed, lets you choose the managed package-library baseline and optional repo adapters, and asks for confirmation before applying.

Every wizard step shows the same shortcuts before you answer: `Enter number(s) | d details | b back | q quit | ? help`. Detailed mode is on by default, so menu rows explain what each choice does, when to choose it, and the tradeoff. Press `d` at any prompt for compact mode; compact mode still keeps the one-line summary for each option. Use `q` or Ctrl-C to quit; bare Esc is ignored so terminal arrow-key sequences do not cancel selection.

The wizard stays dependency-free and uses standard terminal controls. Multi-select screens use a checkbox UI in real terminals: move with arrows or `j`/`k`, press `Space` to toggle global packs, repo-visible packs, or platforms, and press `Enter` to accept. Scripted or non-TTY streams fall back to line-mode comma-separated choices. It uses semantic color and simple status glyphs only when the terminal supports them; `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, non-TTY output, `--no-color`, and `--color never` keep output free of ANSI color. Use `--color always` or `--glyphs unicode` only for an interactive terminal where you explicitly want that rendering; `--glyphs ascii` keeps portable labels such as `[OK]`, `[WARN]`, and `[FAIL]`.

The legacy public form still opens the same wizard when a terminal is available:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CruxExperts/localsetup/main/install | bash -s -- --yes --tools codex
```

The public command is release-backed even though the small wrapper is downloaded from `main`: managed bootstrap installs resolve the latest non-draft, non-prerelease GitHub release tag before cloning or refreshing `~/.local/share/localsetup/source`, with a stable-tag fallback when release lookup is unavailable. Set `LOCALSETUP_BOOTSTRAP_REF` only when you intentionally want an explicit branch, tag, or commit. Explicit `--directory` checkouts are source-authoritative and are never auto-fetched or replaced.

When raw managed bootstrap finds a clean legacy managed source checkout identified by `_localsetup/tools/localsetup.py`, it recognizes and refreshes that checkout to the release-backed modern layout with `ls/tools/localsetup.py`. Before fetching and replacing the checkout, Localsetup stores a Git rollback bundle and JSON manifest outside the source checkout under `<source-parent>/state/source-migrations` when that location is external, or `~/.local/share/localsetup/state/source-migrations` otherwise. Dirty or untracked source checkouts remain rejected before refresh.

For release verification, download the GitHub release tarball with its `.sha256` sidecar and run:

```bash
uv run --locked python ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . verify-release dist/localsetup-v$(cat VERSION).tar.gz
```

Selecting tools in the wizard, or passing `--tools` / `--platforms`, attaches adapters such as `.agents/skills` to the chosen target. For repo-targeted CLI automation with no platform or package selectors, Localsetup uses auto mode: existing Localsetup state is inferred and refreshed, safe legacy repairs are applied only when unambiguous, and a brand-new repo gets the `normal` global package baseline with no repo adapter paths. Interactive installs first choose the global package-library baseline, defaulting to `normal` or the prior registry setting. Repo setup is a separate choice; when selected, repo-visible packs default from the target lockfile or repo-detected suggestions.

For automation, opt in explicitly:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CruxExperts/localsetup/main/install | bash -s -- --non-interactive --yes
```

Automation mode preserves machine-readable output. Without a terminal, the installer asks you to rerun with a TTY or with `--non-interactive --yes`.
For a managed release bootstrap, this mode also provisions the source checkout's locked production environment before running the CLI; explicit checkout installs continue to require `--sync-env` when environment synchronization is wanted.


Localsetup CLI commands emit JSON by default unless a command has an explicit human-readable mode such as `context --markdown`. The `--json` config flag remains available when scripts want to make that output contract explicit.

From a cloned checkout, open the same wizard:

```bash
./install --directory .
```

The local checkout command uses that checkout as the registered source. Like the raw global bootstrap, it installs the managed skill library and creates no repo adapter paths unless you pass `--tools` or `--platforms` or run a repo-targeted auto-mode command. Both paths also create a managed user command at `~/.local/bin/localsetup`. After registration, run Localsetup from any project:

```bash
localsetup plan --target-directory .
localsetup install --target-directory . --apply
localsetup update --target-directory .
```

When invoked through the managed command, Localsetup uses the registered framework checkout as the source and the nearest Git worktree root from your current directory as the target. Outside Git, it targets the current directory. Use `--target-directory /path/to/project` to override that target.

Attach adapters only for the hosts you choose:

```bash
localsetup install --tools codex,kilo --yes
```

Explicit selectors such as `--platforms`, `--global-packs`, `--global-preset`, `--repo-packs`, `--repo-skills`, `--packs`, or `--skills` bypass auto mode and keep the requested shape.

Tune the package footprint by preset, pack, taxonomy class, tag, individual skill, or exclusion:

```bash
localsetup install --tools codex --preset suggested --skill-classes development --skill-tags git --skills ls-context --exclude-skills ls-linux-patcher --yes
```

Presets are `core`, `normal`, `suggested`, `all`, and `custom`. `core` is the compact baseline; `normal` is the fresh global default with bootstrap, core, dev, frontend, architecture, ops, and publishing packs; `suggested` starts with `core` plus repo-detected categories; `all` installs every shipped skill and workflow package; `custom` relies on the packs, classes, tags, and skills you name. `--exclude-skills` removes named skills from the resolved selection unless a selected workflow requires them. The legacy selector flags apply to both the managed global baseline and repo-visible adapter selection for compatibility. Use `--global-packs` / `--global-preset` and `--repo-packs` / `--repo-preset` when you want the managed library to contain a broader baseline than a target repo exposes.

Install every shipped skill and workflow package for Codex, Kilo, and OpenCode, while syncing the uv-managed Python dependency environment:

```bash
./install --directory . --tools codex,kilo,opencode --packs bootstrap,core,dev,frontend,architecture,ops,integrations,publishing,harness,skill-lifecycle,growth-content,specialized --sync-env
```

In symlink mode, Localsetup writes a scoped marker and managed per-package links inside each selected repo adapter path. The adapter directory itself remains a shared agent surface: custom skills, ordinary files, and repo-local symlinks may live beside Localsetup-managed entries and must be preserved. Same-name selected package collisions and unsafe symlinks still block before mutation. That means a repo sees only the repo-visible Localsetup skills and workflow packages even when the global library contains a larger baseline. Portable mode uses the same scoped marker and package list, but copies selected managed packages instead of linking them. See [ls/docs/ADAPTER_OWNERSHIP.md](ls/docs/ADAPTER_OWNERSHIP.md) for the ownership boundary.

Attach a selected adapter to another repo while using this checkout as the source:

```bash
./install --directory /path/to/localsetup --target-directory /path/to/project --tools cursor
```

To convert a repo that may contain old Localsetup files or adapter paths, start with a dry report and apply only after blockers are clear:

```bash
localsetup convert --tools codex --packs core
localsetup convert --tools codex --packs core --yes
```

Conversion writes a timestamped backup and machine-readable report under `.localsetup/backups/conversion-*`, archives known managed or legacy Localsetup artifacts, backs up and removes stale target `ls/` folders, blocks ambiguous unmanaged content, installs selected adapters, and verifies the result.

Windows support is WSL2-only in the current framework. Open WSL2, change to the repo path, and run the Bash installer.

Opt-in harness automation is documented separately because normal installs never schedule autonomous work. See [ls/docs/HARNESS_AUTOMATION.md](ls/docs/HARNESS_AUTOMATION.md) for `localsetup harness codex-heartbeat plan/init/enable/status/budget/run/disable`.

## 10 reasons to use Localsetup

1. **Your agent context becomes code.** Instructions, skills, workflows, platform manifests, and docs live in the repo, so changes are visible in git instead of hidden in a local profile or a forgotten prompt.
2. **One skill library reaches multiple agent hosts.** When selected with `--tools` or `--platforms`, the shipped adapters let Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, OpenClaw, Kilo, and OpenCode attach to the same managed Localsetup skill library.
3. **It leans into portable skill packaging.** Skills use spec-compatible `SKILL.md` frontmatter, which makes them easier to import, export, normalize, and share across ecosystems that understand the package shape.
4. **It tackles the trust gap directly.** The framework pushes agents toward repeatable workflows, explicit verification, documented assumptions, and human gates instead of one-off "looks good" responses.
5. **It treats skill imports as supply-chain events.** External skills are discovered, validated, security-screened, summarized, and normalized before they become part of your library.
6. **It helps with the work developers actually hand agents.** Debugging, tests, PR review, codebase navigation, docs cleanup, git recovery, MCP building, Linux service triage, patching, and release chores are covered out of the box.
7. **It has safety rails for real machines.** Server and operations workflows route through tmux, sudo probing, backup/safety guidance, and explicit approval points for risky actions.
8. **It gives long-running work a shape.** First-class workflow packages, decision trees, PRD queues, Agent Q handoffs, generated registries, and outcome templates make multi-step agent work easier to restart, audit, and delegate.
9. **It makes installs reversible.** The Localsetup installer plans, applies, verifies, writes lock/registry metadata, supports adapter detach, and can roll back managed paths without treating generated adapter output as source.
10. **It keeps releases tidy.** Version sync, generated facts, strict manifest schemas, checksum/SBOM sidecars, framework audit, and Conventional Commit release tooling reduce the drift that makes public repos feel abandoned.

## Install lifecycle

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/localsetup-install-lifecycle.svg" alt="Localsetup install lifecycle: doctor, configure, context, plan, install, verify, ship, and rollback" width="960">
</p>

The Bash wrapper stays thin. The Python CLI handles preflight, dependency setup, adapter planning, managed skill installation, verification, generated docs, packaging, and rollback.

Useful commands:

```bash
localsetup doctor
localsetup plan --target-directory .
localsetup install --target-directory . --apply
localsetup update --target-directory .
localsetup doctor repair --target-directory .
localsetup verify --tools codex --level filesystem
localsetup diff --tools codex
localsetup skill search context
localsetup workflow info ls-workflow-audit-framework
localsetup why --packs core
localsetup graph
localsetup adopt --target-directory .
localsetup sbom --out /tmp/localsetup-source.cdx.json
uv run --locked python ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . context --markdown
uv run --locked python ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . validate-catalog
uv run --locked python ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . audit-global-first
uv run --locked python ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . rollback
```

Use `--trace-json /path/to/events.jsonl` with `install`, `verify`, or `doctor` to append local JSONL trace events for automation review.

For a complete option table, see the [command reference](ls/docs/COMMAND_REFERENCE.md).

`doctor` reports the uv-managed source checkout environment. `doctor repair` emits a dry-run JSON repair report for legacy or partial target repos, and applies only low-ambiguity Localsetup-owned repairs when rerun with `--yes`. Repair now treats workflow packages as first-class inferred packages, preserves benign adapter content by default, and can emit compact handoff prompts with `--agent-prompt` or `--emit-agent-prompt`. Adapter-shaped directories such as `.codex/skills` and `.agents/skills` are shared surfaces, not Localsetup-exclusive directories; repair must preserve custom skills, ordinary files, and repo-local symlinks in place while mutating only proven Localsetup-managed entries. Clean legacy `ls` framework trees are removed only after backup and, when tracked, `git rm --cached`; protected source checkouts still allow safe adapter and lock refreshes, while custom, dirty, symlinked, unsafe, or content-divergent `ls` trees are preserved for migration planning. If `doctor` sees an old `~/.local/share/localsetup/venv` from earlier releases, it reports that legacy venv as ignored and gives a repair hint instead of trying to execute it.

Release note for this repair behavior: `.localsetup/lock.json` is managed repo state and should stay visible to Git. Runtime summaries, journals, backups, health state, and context-index runtime data are local runtime state and are added to `.git/info/exclude`.

## What Localsetup is solving

Agent tooling moves quickly, but the hard parts stay stubbornly practical. Teams still need context that survives across sessions, standards that work across tools, safety around imported instructions, and workflows that can be resumed by another human or agent without archaeology.

Localsetup's opinion is simple: keep the agent operating model close to the code. Make it installable. Make it reviewable. Make it boring enough to trust.

The design follows a few durable pressures instead of chasing market snapshots:

- Agents need repo-owned context, not only session memory.
- Imported instructions and skills need supply-chain treatment before they are trusted.
- Tool and data access should be explicit, least-privilege, and reviewable.
- Long-running work needs checkpoints, validation evidence, and handoff notes.
- Interoperability work such as [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) and [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) is useful, but Localsetup keeps those integrations source-owned and replaceable.

## Requirements

- Python `>= 3.12`
- Bash on Linux, macOS, or WSL2
- Git and network access to GitHub for raw bootstrap, unless installing from a local clone
- Required for dependency sync: `uv`, with dependency intent in `pyproject.toml` and the committed `uv.lock`.
- Recommended: `rg`; GitHub/network access is needed for raw bootstrap unless installing from a local clone.

Use uv-managed dependency setup instead of system Python changes:

```bash
./install --directory . --sync-env
```

The default dependency mode is report-only. It can warn about corrupt legacy Localsetup environments, but it does not move files. Explicit sync paths such as `--sync-env` may quarantine only Localsetup-owned corrupt environments and then let uv rebuild the source checkout `.venv`; a target project's own `.venv` is never modified.
