# Workflow packages

Localsetup separates reusable agent capability from reusable agent orchestration.

- A **skill** is a portable capability package under `_localsetup/skills/ls-*`.
- A **workflow package** is a named orchestration package under `_localsetup/workflows/ls-workflow-*`.
- Both install into the managed package library because both include a valid Agent Skills `SKILL.md`.
- Workflow packages also include `workflow.yaml`, which is Localsetup-specific metadata for aliases, required skills, gates, phases, validation, outputs, and migration notes.

The practical rule is simple: use a skill when the agent needs a capability, and use a workflow package when the agent needs a repeatable task flow with known gates and evidence.

## Source layout

| Source root | Package pattern | Required files | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_localsetup/skills/` | `ls-*` | `SKILL.md` | Portable capability packages. |
| `_localsetup/workflows/` | `ls-workflow-*` | `SKILL.md`, `workflow.yaml` | Executable workflow packages with Localsetup orchestration metadata. |

The `SKILL.md` file keeps the workflow executable by agent hosts that understand Agent Skills. The `workflow.yaml` file lets Localsetup validate and generate framework-specific registry data.

## Install behavior

The installer copies selected skills and selected workflow packages into:

```text
~/.local/share/localsetup/packages
```

When selected with `--tools` or `--platforms`, platform adapters such as `.codex/skills`, `.kilo/skills`, and `.cursor/skills` attach to that managed library by symlink or portable copy. A workflow package therefore appears beside normal skills at runtime, but its source and metadata stay separate in `_localsetup/workflows/`.

Workflow pack selection also pulls in required capability skills. For example, a pre-publish workflow can require publishing, versioning, and audit skills without duplicating those instructions inside the workflow package.

Installed workflow packages are materialized outputs, not the canonical source tree. Runtime-facing Markdown references to public framework docs are rewritten into `references/localsetup/docs/...`, and copied public docs are bundled under that package-local reference root. Each emitted package includes `references/localsetup/.localsetup-reference-bundle.json` with the copied references, rewrites, source-only metadata, exclusions, and validation status.

`workflow.yaml.required_docs` stays source-repo validation metadata. Localsetup validates those paths against the source checkout and records them in the transform manifest as source-only metadata, but does not rewrite the YAML values for runtime hosts. Private, blocked, or traversal-style `required_docs` entries are rejected before an emitted package is written.

## Generated docs

These files are generated from workflow manifests:

- [WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md](WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md)
- [WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md](WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md)
- [_generated/workflow-catalog.json](_generated/workflow-catalog.json)

Do not hand-maintain workflow rows in those files. Update the relevant `_localsetup/workflows/<package>/workflow.yaml` and regenerate docs instead:

```bash
uv run --locked python _localsetup/tools/generate_docs_artifacts.py --repo-root .
uv run --locked python _localsetup/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . generate-docs
```

## Validation

Use the catalog validator after editing skills or workflow packages:

```bash
uv run --locked python _localsetup/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . validate-catalog
```

The validator checks that workflow package names match `ls-workflow-<workflow_id>`, `SKILL.md` names match directory names, aliases do not collide, dependencies exist, required docs and tools resolve inside the repo, and each package has a smoke row.

`localsetup verify` also validates emitted installed packages. It fails when a managed package is missing its transform manifest, has invalid emitted package metadata, leaks private maintenance paths, has symlink escapes, or leaves runtime-facing Markdown references pointed at source-checkout framework docs.

When the optional Agent Skills CLI is available, validate both source roots:

```bash
agentskills validate _localsetup/skills/ls-context
agentskills validate _localsetup/workflows/ls-workflow-spec-clarify-reverse
```

## Adding or changing a workflow package

1. Create or edit `_localsetup/workflows/ls-workflow-<id>/`.
2. Keep `SKILL.md` concise and Agent Skills compliant.
3. Put Localsetup orchestration metadata in `workflow.yaml`.
4. Reference existing docs and tools instead of pasting large procedures.
5. Add or update tests for new validator, installer, generation, or package behavior.
6. Regenerate docs and run validation.
