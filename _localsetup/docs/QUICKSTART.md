# Quickstart

Use this page to install Localsetup, choose agent platforms, verify the install, and update later. For copy-paste command tables, see [Command reference](COMMAND_REFERENCE.md). For the product pitch, see the [root README](../../README.md).

## Requirements

- Python `>= 3.12`
- Bash on Linux, macOS, or WSL2
- Git and network access to GitHub for raw bootstrap, unless installing from a local clone
- Required for dependency sync: `uv`, with dependency intent in `pyproject.toml` and the committed `uv.lock`.
- Recommended: `rg`; GitHub/network access is needed for raw bootstrap unless installing from a local clone.

Windows is WSL2-only in Localsetup. Native PowerShell install is intentionally not supported; run the Bash installer inside WSL2.

## Install In One Command

Global bootstrap from any directory:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CruxExperts/localsetup/main/install | bash -s --
```

This opens a terminal wizard. The raw bootstrap wrapper checks the latest stable GitHub release, falls back to the latest stable-looking tag when the release API is unavailable, creates or refreshes the managed source checkout from that ref, shows the source/release status, target, managed package library, selected platforms and packs, then asks for confirmation before applying.

The wizard uses guided choices on every step. Single-choice prompts show `Enter number(s) | d details | b back | q quit | ? help`; detailed mode is on by default and explains what each option does, when to choose it, and its tradeoff. Multi-select prompts use checkbox controls in real terminals: move with arrows or `j`/`k`, press `Space` to toggle global packs, repo-visible packs, or platforms, and press `Enter` to accept. Scripted streams fall back to comma-separated line input. Press `d` to switch to compact mode when you only want the one-line summaries. Use `q` or Ctrl-C to quit; bare Esc is ignored so terminal arrow-key sequences do not cancel selection.

Color and glyphs are optional presentation aids, not part of the automation contract. Interactive runs default to `--color auto --glyphs auto`, honor `NO_COLOR`, avoid color on `TERM=dumb` and non-TTY output, and fall back to text labels such as `[OK]`, `[WARN]`, and `[FAIL]` when Unicode is not appropriate. Use `--no-color`, `--color never`, or `--glyphs ascii` for portable logs.

The old public command form still opens the wizard when a terminal is available:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CruxExperts/localsetup/main/install | bash -s -- --yes --tools codex
```

The public command is release-backed even though the small wrapper is downloaded from `main`: managed bootstrap installs resolve the latest non-draft, non-prerelease GitHub release tag before cloning or refreshing `~/.local/share/localsetup/source`, with a stable-tag fallback when release lookup is unavailable. Set `LOCALSETUP_BOOTSTRAP_REF` only when you intentionally want an explicit branch, tag, or commit. Explicit `--directory` checkouts are source-authoritative and are never auto-fetched or replaced.

For release verification, use the GitHub release tarball and its `.sha256` sidecar, then run:

```bash
uv run --locked python _localsetup/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . verify-release dist/localsetup-v$(cat VERSION).tar.gz
```

Release builds also publish a CycloneDX SBOM sidecar. When it is available, include it in verification:

```bash
uv run --locked python _localsetup/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . verify-release \
  dist/localsetup-v$(cat VERSION).tar.gz \
  --sha256 dist/localsetup-v$(cat VERSION).tar.gz.sha256 \
  --sbom dist/localsetup-v$(cat VERSION).tar.gz.cdx.json
```

Selecting tools in the wizard, or passing `--tools` / `--platforms`, attaches adapters such as `.codex/skills` to the selected target. If no tools are selected, the install is global-library-only. Interactive installs first choose the global package-library baseline, defaulting to `core` or the prior registry setting. Repo setup is a separate choice; when selected, repo-visible packs default from the target lockfile or repo-detected suggestions.

For scripts and CI, use explicit automation mode:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CruxExperts/localsetup/main/install | bash -s -- --non-interactive --yes
```

Automation mode keeps machine-readable output. Without a terminal and without `--non-interactive --yes`, the installer exits with a short message explaining both choices.

Localsetup CLI commands emit JSON by default unless a command has an explicit human-readable mode such as `context --markdown`. The `--json` config flag remains available when scripts want to make that output contract explicit.

From a local checkout:

```bash
./install --directory .
```

The local checkout command uses that checkout as the registered source. Like the raw global bootstrap, it installs the default `core` pack into the managed library, registers `~/.local/bin/localsetup`, and does not create repo adapter paths unless you pass `--tools` or `--platforms`. If `~/.local/bin` is not on `PATH`, the installer warns and the command becomes available after you add that directory to your shell path.

After registration, run Localsetup from any project:

```bash
localsetup install --tools codex --yes
```

The global command uses the registered Localsetup checkout as source. For repo-scoped commands, it targets the nearest Git worktree root from your current directory, or the exact current directory outside Git. Override that with `--target-directory`.

Attach selected agent hosts explicitly:

```bash
localsetup install --tools codex,kilo --yes
```

Select packages by preset, pack, taxonomy class, tag, individual skill, or exclusion:

```bash
localsetup install --tools codex --preset suggested --skill-classes development --skill-tags git --skills ls-context --exclude-skills ls-linux-patcher --yes
```

The selector flags are additive except for `--exclude-skills`. Presets are `core`, `suggested`, `all`, and `custom`; automation defaults to `core` when no selector is supplied. `suggested` starts with `core` plus repo-detected additions, while `custom` lets the named packs, classes, tags, and skills define the footprint. Exclusions do not remove skills required by a selected workflow. The legacy selector flags apply to both the managed global baseline and repo-visible adapter selection for compatibility. Use `--global-packs` / `--global-preset` and `--repo-packs` / `--repo-preset` when you want the managed library to contain a broader baseline than a target repo exposes.

For a full local setup with all shipped skill and workflow packs attached to Codex, Kilo, and OpenCode:

```bash
./install --directory . --tools codex,kilo,opencode --packs bootstrap,core,dev,ops,integrations,publishing,experimental --sync-env
```

If Python dependencies are missing or you want the uv project environment prepared:

```bash
./install --directory . --sync-env
```

Localsetup does not mutate system Python. Framework libraries sync into the source checkout `.venv` with uv, while app-style CLI tools should use `pipx` when they are distributed as commands.

The default `prompt-only` dependency mode is non-mutating: it reports missing uv, stale locks, and corrupt legacy Localsetup environments with a repair command. Explicit sync paths such as `./install --sync-env` and `--dependency-mode uv-sync` may quarantine only Localsetup-owned corrupt environments, including source checkout `.venv`, `~/.local/share/localsetup/venv`, and target `.localsetup/venv`, then let uv rebuild the source checkout `.venv`. A target project's own `.venv` is application-owned and is never changed.

## Platform IDs

| ID | Agent host | Adapter path | Managed package library |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cursor` | Cursor | `.cursor/skills` | `~/.local/share/localsetup/packages` |
| `claude-code` | Claude Code | `.claude/skills` | `~/.local/share/localsetup/packages` |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI | `.codex/skills` | `~/.local/share/localsetup/packages` |
| `openclaw` | OpenClaw | `.openclaw/skills` | `~/.local/share/localsetup/packages` |
| `kilo` | Kilo CLI | `.kilo/skills` | `~/.local/share/localsetup/packages` |
| `opencode` | OpenCode CLI | `.opencode/skills` | `~/.local/share/localsetup/packages` |

Comma-separate multiple IDs:

```bash
./install --directory . --tools cursor,claude-code,codex
```

Omit `--tools` and `--platforms` on a source-only install for a global-only install. No omitted selector expands to every platform. For repo-targeted CLI automation, selector-free commands use auto mode:

```bash
localsetup plan --target-directory .
localsetup install --target-directory . --apply
localsetup update --target-directory .
```

Auto mode refreshes inferred existing adapters, applies only safe legacy repairs, or installs the suggested global baseline for a brand-new repo without creating adapter paths.

Attach an adapter to another repo or directory while using this checkout as the source:

```bash
./install --directory /path/to/localsetup --target-directory /path/to/project --tools cursor
```

Convert a repo that may already contain old Localsetup files:

```bash
localsetup convert --tools codex --packs core
localsetup convert --tools codex --packs core --yes
```

The first command is a dry report. Apply mode writes a timestamped backup and `conversion-report.json`, archives known managed or legacy Localsetup artifacts, backs up and removes stale target `_localsetup/` folders, blocks ambiguous unmanaged content, installs selected adapters, and verifies the result.

## What Gets Installed

- A registered framework source checkout under `~/.local/share/localsetup/source` or the checkout passed with `--directory`
- Managed skills under `~/.local/share/localsetup/packages`
- Managed workflow packages under the same library; their source remains `_localsetup/workflows/ls-workflow-*`
- Explicitly selected platform adapter paths such as `.codex/skills` or `.kilo/skills`
- `.localsetup/lock.json` and reports that support verification and rollback
- Transaction journals under `.localsetup/install-journal/` for applied installs

Consuming target repos do not receive `_localsetup/` by default. If conversion finds an old target `_localsetup/`, it backs it up under `.localsetup/backups/` and removes it before installing adapters.

Selected adapters use symlink mode by default. Use portable mode when symlinks are not suitable:

```bash
./install --directory . --tools codex --mode portable
```

Symlink mode creates a scoped adapter directory rather than a monolithic link to the whole global library. The adapter contains `.localsetup-adapter.json` and one symlink per selected repo-visible package, so the repo sees only the selected skills and workflow packages even when the global library contains a broader baseline. Portable mode uses the same marker and scoped package list, but copies selected packages into the adapter.

## Verify

For a target repo, verify the installed adapter state:

```bash
localsetup verify --tools codex
localsetup doctor --tools codex
```

For the Localsetup source checkout itself, maintainers can also run source checks:

```bash
uv run --locked python _localsetup/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . validate-catalog
uv run --locked python _localsetup/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . audit-global-first
```

After using `--sync-env`, `doctor` reports uv path/version, lock status, the source checkout `.venv` interpreter when present, and any repair metadata from dependency sync. Old global or target-local Localsetup venvs from earlier releases are reported as ignored legacy state in prompt-only mode and quarantined only when explicit sync is requested.

Agent-readable install context:

```bash
uv run --locked python _localsetup/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . context --markdown
```

Verify supports the explicit `filesystem` level, which runs the implemented local rule engine:

```bash
localsetup verify --tools codex --level filesystem
```

Use JSONL tracing when automation needs resumable evidence:

```bash
localsetup verify --tools codex --level filesystem --trace-json /tmp/localsetup-events.jsonl
localsetup doctor --trace-json /tmp/localsetup-events.jsonl
```

Inspect planned changes against the current lockfile before applying:

```bash
localsetup diff --tools codex
```

Search the installed catalog and explain pack selection:

```bash
localsetup skill search context
localsetup skill info ls-context
localsetup workflow search audit
localsetup workflow info ls-workflow-audit-framework
localsetup why --packs core
localsetup graph
localsetup adopt --target-directory .
```

Generate SBOMs for the source tree or an installed target:

```bash
localsetup sbom --out /tmp/localsetup-source.cdx.json
localsetup sbom --installed --target-directory . --out /tmp/localsetup-installed.cdx.json
```

## Update

Re-run install with the same directory and platform selection:

```bash
./install --directory . --tools codex,kilo
```

The installer refreshes managed skills, selected adapter links or portable copies, lock metadata, and reports. A global-only re-run refreshes the managed library and records an empty platform list. The wizard reloads prior global baseline selectors from the registry and repo-visible selections from `.localsetup/lock.json`; choosing no repo setup on a prior target removes managed adapter state while keeping the shared package library intact.

Selected workflow packs also refresh their workflow packages and required capability skill dependencies. See [Workflow packages](WORKFLOW_PACKAGES.md) for canonical source/runtime and install details.

Non-interactive strict policy blocks high-risk skill metadata unless the operator explicitly chooses a less restrictive mode:

```bash
localsetup install --tools codex --policy-mode strict --yes
```

Use `detach` when you only want to remove selected adapter paths while preserving shared managed packages and registry references:

```bash
localsetup detach --tools codex --target-directory .
```

## Roll Back Managed Paths

```bash
uv run --locked python _localsetup/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . rollback
```

Rollback only acts on managed paths recorded by Localsetup metadata.
