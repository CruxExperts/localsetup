# Final Reviewer Report

## Verdict

No blocking findings. The workspace state satisfies the requested audit and remediation-planning objective at the artifact and internal-consistency level: required audit files exist, the four named lane reports are saved, bootstrap-pack index and metadata are present, pack metadata agrees with generated indexes, YAML/JSON parsing passes, `validate-catalog` passes, `git diff --check` is clean, and changed/new local links checked clean.

## Finding

| ID | Severity | Path | Evidence | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RVW-001 | low | `.codex/runs/20260510-223606-codex-bootstrap-pack-audit.md` | Ledger showed final reviewer pending before this report was recorded. | Record final reviewer result in the ledger and final checkpoint before acceptance. |

## Acceptance Checklist

| Requirement | Result |
|---|---|
| Required artifacts exist | yes |
| Named agent reports exist | yes |
| Bootstrap index and metadata are coherent | yes |
| `FINDINGS.yaml` and `REMEDIATION_TASKS.yaml` parse and link logically | yes |
| Pack metadata and generated index agree | yes |
| Mission questions answered | yes |
| Approval boundaries recorded | yes |
| Change risk scope is repo-local docs, prompts, indexes, metadata, and generated docs | yes |
| Validation evidence sufficient for audit/planning scope | yes |
| Broken local links introduced | none found |

## Residual Risks

- Global Codex hardening and legacy replacement require approval and remain planned, not executed.
- Audit/bootstrap directories are untracked until intentionally staged for commit.
- Custom-agent TOML schema claims remain partly source-inferred because no complete public schema page was found.

## Resolution

RVW-001 was resolved by updating the run ledger after the reviewer report.
