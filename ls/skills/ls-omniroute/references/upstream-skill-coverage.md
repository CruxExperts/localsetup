# OmniRoute Upstream Skill Coverage

LocalSetup consolidates OmniRoute v3.8.48 into four native skills:

- `ls-omniroute`: first routing, issue triage, env/auth preflight, generic deterministic API CLI, Codex and agent-client onboarding.
- `ls-omniroute-proxy`: all read-only model/provider, context, observability, integration, client and endpoint discovery, plus sanitized normalized model observations.
- `ls-omniroute-admin-automation`: every write, import, purge, service, settings, provider, key, integration, backup/restore and rollback-safe control workflow.
- `ls-omniroute-update`: immutable source provenance, update reporting, coverage and strict freshness validation.

Rows listing both proxy and admin have a mixed read/write surface: proxy owns discovery and admin owns mutation. `omni-github-skills` discovery is read-only; any import is handed to LocalSetup vetting/import/sandbox policy before admin mutation.

## Maintenance Rule

When updating OmniRoute, refresh this coverage map and the `NATIVE_COVERAGE` mapping in `../../ls-omniroute-update/scripts/omniroute_update.py` from the pinned upstream `skills/*/SKILL.md` inventory before changing pack membership. Keep the four-owner boundary unless a future upstream skill introduces a functional area that none of these surfaces can safely own.
