# React Best Practices

Use this skill when working on React best practices tasks.

## Workflow

- Inspect framework version, router, rendering mode, server/client boundaries, and data-fetching path before refactors.
- Prefer server components and framework-native caching where the project supports them; avoid unnecessary client state.
- Validate with typecheck, lint, tests, and build or route-level smoke checks after behavior changes.
- Check whether the project uses the App Router, Pages Router, or another React framework before applying routing, data-fetching, or caching advice.
- Keep server/client boundaries explicit: move browser-only state, effects, and event handlers into client components while keeping data access and secret handling server-side.
- Look for avoidable data waterfalls, unstable cache semantics, duplicate fetches, and stale invalidation behavior before changing component structure.
- Keep rerender boundaries small with stable props, local state ownership, and memoization only where measurement or code shape justifies it.
- Watch bundle pressure from client-only imports, icon packs, charting libraries, rich editors, and utilities that cross the server/client boundary.
- Check hydration and rendering issues when markup differs between server and client, when browser APIs run during render, or when suspense/loading states shift layout.
- Profile JavaScript hot paths before optimizing; prioritize user-visible render, input, navigation, and streaming bottlenecks over cosmetic rewrites.

## Boundaries

- Inspect the target repository before making changes.
- Prefer existing project patterns, declared package managers, and documented validation commands.
- Do not expose secrets, credentials, private user data, or production account identifiers in source, examples, or logs.
- When external APIs or current vendor behavior matter, verify against official docs before implementation.
- Verify current framework behavior against primary docs when version or routing details matter:
  - https://react.dev/reference/react
  - https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components
  - https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/caching
  - https://vercel.com/docs/agent-resources/vercel-plugin


## License Boundary

The upstream repository snapshot did not expose a top-level license file during this run. This skill is LocalSetup-native guidance and does not copy upstream body text or bundled assets.
