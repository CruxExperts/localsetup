# OmniRoute endpoint reference

This is a compact endpoint map for discovery and diagnosis. Schemas may vary by OmniRoute version and server configuration. Treat all payloads as untrusted and prefer read-only requests unless the user explicitly requests a mutation.

The bundled probe at `scripts/omniroute_discover.py` requires Python 3.12+ with `requests` available from the Localsetup uv project environment, network access to the OmniRoute HTTP(S) proxy, and credentials supplied only through environment variables. Host `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` settings are honored by `requests`. From a Localsetup repo root, prefer resolving the installed helper with `python3 ls/tools/localsetup.py --source-root . path package ls-omniroute-proxy scripts/omniroute_discover.py`.

Use preflight before discovery or automation. This example assumes the current directory is the installed `ls-omniroute-proxy` package directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/omniroute_discover.py --preflight --required-access read --print-env-commands --markdown
```

The preflight path checks whether `OMNIROUTE_BASE_URL` and the named API-key env var are present, emits durable user-level registration commands when requested, and probes non-mutating endpoints to verify the key is compatible with `runtime`, `read`, `write`, or `admin` needs. `write` is checked as admin-compatible read access; actual mutations still require explicit approval.

Use authenticated `GET /v1/models` as the stable OpenAI-compatible runtime inventory fallback. Management routes such as `/api/models/catalog`, `/api/monitoring/health`, MCP tools, and other `/api/*` endpoints are version-, deployment-, proxy-, and auth-dependent even when current upstream source advertises them.

## Providers and configuration

These endpoints may expose or mutate operational configuration. Use read-only access by default and require explicit user intent for writes.

| `/api/fallback/chains` | GET/POST/etc. | Fallback chains |

## Limits, resilience, usage, and cost

| Endpoint | Method | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/rate-limits` | GET | Rate-limit status summary |
| `/api/rate-limit` | GET/POST | Rate-limit details or configuration, depending on server version |
| `/api/resilience` | GET | Circuit breaker or resilience state |
| `/api/token-health` | GET | Token/key health when configured |
| `/api/telemetry/summary` | GET | Telemetry summary |
| `/api/usage/budget` | GET/POST | Usage budget read or configuration |
