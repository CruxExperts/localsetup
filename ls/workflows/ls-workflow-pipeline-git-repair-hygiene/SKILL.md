Use this pipeline package for broken Git state recovery plus compliance hardening.
Use `ls-unfuck-my-git-state` for repair, then `ls-git-workflows` and
`ls-framework-compliance` for Git hygiene and compliance checks. These skills own
the procedures; use [Git traceability](../../docs/GIT_TRACEABILITY.md) for
immutable artifact references.
