Use this pipeline package to onboard skills with consistent checks.
Use [SKILL_IMPORTING.md](../../docs/SKILL_IMPORTING.md) for the staged onboarding
contract and final copy gates. Follow the owning skills for each capability:

- [ls-skill-vetter](../../skills/ls-skill-vetter/SKILL.md) for source and trust review.
- [ls-skill-importer](../../skills/ls-skill-importer/SKILL.md) for candidate staging
  and gated import.
- [ls-skill-normalizer](../../skills/ls-skill-normalizer/SKILL.md) for normalization.
- [ls-skill-sandbox-tester](../../skills/ls-skill-sandbox-tester/SKILL.md) for
  post-normalization smoke checks.

These sources own the procedures and acceptance gates; this package composes them.
