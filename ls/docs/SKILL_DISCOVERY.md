# Skill discovery (public registries)

**Purpose:** How the framework discovers and recommends publicly available skills from external collections (e.g. awesome lists, ClawHub). Used together with skill-creator and skill-importer so users can find similar existing skills before creating or importing.

## Where the registry and index live

- **This project's GitHub repository** maintains its own copy of the public skill registry and (when refreshed) the public skill index. The canonical files live under `ls/docs/`: [PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls](PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls) and [PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml](PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml). When you install or update the framework, you get these files under `ls/docs/`.
- **Two ways to use them:**
  - **Use the project's maintained copies:** If you do not want to maintain your own list or index, you can download the latest registry and (optionally) index from the project's GitHub repo (e.g. raw files from the default branch, or pull/update the framework so `ls/` gets the latest). That way you always have the project's curated registry URLs and, if the project publishes a pre-built index, an up-to-date index without building it yourself.
  - **Maintain your own:** Edit [PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls](PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls) and refresh [PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml](PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml) locally. Your changes stay in your repo and are not overwritten unless you reinstall or overwrite those files. The agent uses whatever is in `ls/docs/` for discovery.

## Public repo registry

- **File:** [PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls](PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls)
- **Format:** One URL per line. Lines starting with `#` are ignored. No trailing spaces. URLs point to skill collections (e.g. [VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills)), GitHub repos, or index pages the agent can fetch and parse.
- **Maintenance:** The project repo keeps a maintained copy; add or remove URLs as new public registries become available. The agent and any refresh tool read this file to know where to look for skills.

## Public skill index

- **File:** [PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml](PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml)
- **Schema:** `schema_version`, `sources` (optional list of URLs), `updated` (ISO8601 date or datetime of last refresh), `skills`. Each skill entry includes `name`, `description`, `url`, `source_registry`, optional `category`, and enriched metadata (`summary_short`, `summary_long`, `capabilities`, `requirements`, `risk_flags`, `quality_signals`). Used for stronger similarity matching and richer recommendation output.
- **Refresh + scrub (mandatory sequence):** The index must always go through both steps before use. Refresh fetches new entries from registries; scrub fixes the stub/placeholder descriptions that refresh inevitably produces. Run them in order:

  ```
  # Step 1: fetch from registries
  uv run --locked python ls/tools/refresh_public_skill_index.py

  # Step 2: audit and fix descriptions (skip URL check for speed; add --workers 20 for parallelism)
  uv run --locked python ls/tools/skill_index_scrub.py --skip-url-check

  # Step 3: apply fixes
  uv run --locked python ls/tools/skill_index_scrub.py --skip-url-check --fix
  ```

  This normal sequence establishes description/schema readiness only; its summary must say `URL liveness: not checked`. Save a report with `--report path/to/report.md` when needed. The report includes the index `updated` date/age, stale/invalid warnings, and Worker Errors. Full URL liveness checking requires omitting `--skip-url-check`; only a completed full check may report `URL liveness: checked`. Use `--fix --prune-dead-urls` with URL checking enabled to remove reviewed hard-dead entries. See the scrub tool's `--help` for all options.

## Index refresh and user prompts

- **When to prompt for refresh:** Base behavior on the index file and the `updated` field. Obtain the current date from the environment (e.g. `date` on Linux/macOS, `Get-Date` in PowerShell) so calculations are correct.
- **Index unavailable or never refreshed:** Ranking requires a readable YAML mapping with a list-valued `skills` field. If the index is missing, unreadable, malformed, has the wrong shape, or `updated` is null/missing/empty, **always prompt the user** to build or rebuild it. If the user declines, report that discovery was not run and return no public-index recommendations. End only the discovery subflow; a calling create/import task may continue without those recommendations.
- **Default minimum before prompting:** **7 days.** Do not prompt to refresh if the last refresh (`updated`) was less than 7 days ago. If `updated` is 7 or more days ago, prompt the user to refresh: e.g. "The public skill index was last refreshed on YYYY-MM-DD (X days ago). Would you like to refresh it now for up-to-date recommendations?"
- **On every skill operation:** Whenever the user does a skill operation that uses discovery (creating a skill, importing a skill, or asking to discover/recommend public skills), **remind them** of the last refresh and how long ago it was. For example: "Last index refresh: 2026-02-10 (8 days ago)." Use the actual `updated` date and compute the elapsed time in **days** (e.g. "3 days ago"), **weeks** (e.g. "2 weeks ago"), or **years** (e.g. "1 year ago") as appropriate. Then, if the index is older than 7 days, add the prompt: "The index is over 7 days old. Would you like to refresh it now?"
- **After a refresh:** When the agent or user completes a refresh, set `updated` in the YAML to the current date/time so the next run can compute "last refreshed X days ago" correctly.

## When discovery runs

- **With skill-creator:** When the user starts creating a new skill (after gathering input and proposing name/triggers), load ls-skill-discovery: compare the proposed purpose/description to the public index; return top 5 similar skills; present options (see skill doc).
- **With skill-importer:** When the user is about to import from a URL or path, optionally check the public index for similar skills and suggest: "Similar public skills exist; would you like to consider one of these instead or in addition?"

## Recommendation flow

1. **Index and refresh:** Read [PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml](PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml). If the readable mapping/list gate fails or `updated` is null, prompt to build it; a decline returns no recommendations and ends discovery. Otherwise show its age. If a stale-index refresh is declined, disclose staleness and continue with the readable entries. If accepted, run refresh then scrub and record both outcomes separately.
2. Only after the readable-index gate passes, compare user intent to index entries; rank and take the top 5. An empty list returns zero matches.
3. **Present recommendations** using the **default recommendation output format** (see below). After the formatted list, offer the four options: (1) In-depth summary of each, (2) Use one (pull and run through our import process so it's compliant), (3) Continue working on your own, (4) Adapt from one (use as base and customize).
4. If user chooses (2) or (4): resolve the skill URL (e.g. from awesome list link to actual repo), then run the skill-importer workflow (fetch, scan, validate, screen, user selects, duplicate check, import). The imported skill becomes framework-compliant; no need to recreate from scratch.

### Default recommendation output format

Discovery always presents the top 5 (or fewer) matches as a ranked structure. Do not use bare names only.

- **Intro line:** one sentence naming the topic and result count.
- **For each skill:** markdown link name, 2-4 sentence summary (prefer `summary_long`, fallback `summary_short`, then `description`), fit rationale, constraints/risks (`requirements`, `risk_flags`), and recommendation status (`import now`, `evaluate later`, `skip`).
- **Rendering fallback:** use rich markdown when available; fallback to numbered blocks; fallback to plain text with labeled lines (`Skill:`, `Summary:`, `Risks:`) when markdown is limited.
- **After the list:** provide the four options (in-depth summary, use public skill, continue on own, adapt from one).

The skill **ls-skill-discovery** (SKILL.md) contains the full format and an example; agents must follow it when returning recommendations.

## Reference

- Load skill **ls-skill-discovery** when the user is creating a new skill, importing a skill, or asking to discover/recommend public skills. Use in conjunction with ls-skill-creator and ls-skill-importer.
