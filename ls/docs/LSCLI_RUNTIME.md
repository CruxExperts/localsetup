# LSCli runtime contracts

This reference owns the implementation contracts behind the [public commands](LSCLI.md):
protected runtime selection, worker transport, authority, sandbox resources,
operation evidence, history recovery and tool-free completion. Internal primitives
are composed by the public controller; calling one primitive is not equivalent
to a qualified run. Grants come from the live owner, never saved model text.

Sections retain deterministic and early installed fixture evidence where it
explains an implementation boundary. Such evidence is historical and scoped to
that fixture; the [installed qualification record](LSCLI_QUALIFICATION.md) collects
larger candidate scenarios. Neither document qualifies every host/provider or an
unexamined published artifact. [SDK_FORK.md](SDK_FORK.md) owns pinned SDK and
artifact provenance. Commands and owner control JSON remain in [LSCLI.md](LSCLI.md).

## Runtime lease foundation

The internal `runtime_use` context manager provides shared use leases and
exclusive upgrade leases over one persistent lock inode in the managed runtime
root. Shared leases coexist; an exclusive lease waits for all users. Waits use a
finite, nonnegative monotonic timeout and raise `TimeoutError` on contention.
Process exit and exceptions release the lease. The lock file is never unlinked
or replaced during normal use, preventing separate lock generations.

The runtime root must already exist, be owned by the current user, and deny
writes to other users. Descriptor-relative traversal rejects symlink components;
the lock must be a private regular file with one hard link. The implementation
requires a qualified POSIX `flock` backend. It does not create runtime directories
or change their permissions. This advisory lock coordinates cooperating callers;
the sandbox must separately prevent untrusted same-user processes from writing
the runtime or replacing its root. Do not rename the root while it is leased.

When an operation also needs the existing framework package-root lock, acquire
that lock first, then the runtime lease. Do not convert a shared lease to an
exclusive lease in place. Installation, selection, and supervised worker lifetimes consume this foundation.
Doctor reports static integrity independently of the per-run authority and
platform checks required for execution.

## Isolated SDK import qualification

Managed installation runs a separate installed Python process with `-I -B` to
qualify SDK imports before sealing or selecting the runtime. Its private
`ls.core.agent.sdk_worker --probe` module verifies the bundled manifest, refuses
preloaded SDK namespaces, and installs a manifest-backed importer for the three
upstream namespaces. It compiles verified source bytes directly, bypassing cached
bytecode. Missing SDK modules cannot fall through to an ambient installation;
loaded module origins must match the private payload. Package resources remain
available through the package loader. The supervisor/bootstrap process does not
import SDK code.

This probe makes no provider request and enables no tools. It establishes import
qualification, not sandbox isolation or agent readiness. The owning caller must
hold the runtime lease and protect the installed tree for worker lifetime;
the coding controller supplies provider transport, broker authority and supervised
dispatch separately from this import probe.

The Python 3.12/Linux installed candidate verified its loaded SDK origins with
inert substitute packages beside the installed distribution and an ambient SDK
path. All loaded SDK modules came from the private payload; removing the fixture
restored the exact runtime inventory. This checks namespace substitution, not
compatibility with every separately installed upstream SDK distribution.

## SDK model adapter

The isolated worker's model factory connects Chat Completions or Responses to
the shared client. It requires the active private importer and checks SDK origins
before model construction and after use. It passes the selected model explicitly
and replaces inferred model profiles with conservative SDK defaults plus declared
tool/schema capabilities; native provider
tools and inferred JSON-object output are disabled. These declarations remain
separate from broker grants and endpoint qualification.

Deterministic fixtures exercise both adapters through the SDK direct-request API,
verify tool-free request bodies and final identity, and deserialize successful
responses. The factory does not independently expose public dispatch or bypass request
budgets, supervisor outcomes, broker permissions, sandbox, or session recovery.

The Python 3.12/Linux installed candidate passed the same deterministic fixtures
outside the checkout, including a model name that triggers upstream inference:
system roles remain explicit and no inferred context-window claim survives.
Installed payload origins and the runtime inventory were verified afterward.

## Bounded worker supervision

The internal `probe_runtime` supervisor holds the selected runtime's shared lease
through worker teardown. It starts installed Python with `-I -B`, a minimal
environment, private umask and a new POSIX process group. Schema-1 stdin currently
accepts only `{"schema_version":1,"operation":"probe"}` followed by EOF. The worker
emits a `ready` event and one qualification `result`, each with schema version,
zero-based sequence, type and object data. This probe protocol is separate from the installed coding worker exchange.

The supervisor concurrently handles pipes with bounded storage: requests up to
4096 bytes, stdout up to 1 MiB, and diagnostics up to 64 KiB. It owns the monotonic
execution deadline, polls cancellation during process supervision, closes stdin
after the request, and kills the process group on exit, timeout, cancellation or
failure. Pipe-holding descendants are terminated when their worker exits. Raw
worker diagnostics are discarded rather than included in terminal results.

Internal terminal states are `completed`, `failed`, `protocol_error`,
`output_limit`, `timed_out`, and `cancelled`. Completion requires both the exact
ready/result protocol and process exit zero; neither alone is success. A result
is not controller acceptance of any repository task. Preflight/lease errors
remain exceptions. Cancellation during lease acquisition or synchronous inventory
verification is not yet interruptible; remaining deadline is checked before
spawn. Process groups do not contain descendants that deliberately create new
sessions; tool-enabled coding therefore uses the qualified sandbox and resource
group. The public run interface adds steering, approvals and explicit recovery;
this probe alone supplies none of those capabilities.

The Python 3.12/Linux installed candidate completed this supervised probe outside
the checkout, with private SDK origins and unchanged runtime inventory. Focused
subprocess fixtures cover malformed/duplicate events, nonzero exit despite a valid
result, output limits, active/pre-start cancellation, deadlines and pipe-holding
children. These checks qualify the probe lifecycle only.

## Task-bound file broker

The internal file broker accepts a supervisor-owned immutable grant bound to a
task, session, absolute workspace root, monotonic expiry and revocation event.
Read, write and provider-disclosure scopes are separate canonical relative paths;
`.` covers the granted tree subject to protected-path rules. Reading for provider
use requires both read and disclosure authority. Grants must never be reconstructed
from model responses, compacted summaries or stored conversations.

Broker reads/writes use one existing private lease root shared by all cooperating
sessions, separate from the workspace. Reads take shared leases and replacements
exclusive leases. Descriptor-relative traversal refuses symlinks; regular files
must be owned by the current user, have one hard link, and lack special modes.
Operations are limited to 8 MiB. Reads reject observed concurrent file changes;
writes use exclusive temporary files, preserve existing mode/owner/group and
extended attributes, flush file data, recheck authority and target identity, then
atomically replace and flush the directory. Failed preparation leaves the original
file in place and removes the temporary file. Missing parent directories are not
created. A directory flush failure after replacement is an uncertain mutation,
which operation-journal reconciliation must resolve before further dispatch.

Private/control path segments `.git`, `.agents`, `.codex`, `.claude`, `.ssh`,
`.env` and `.env.*` are refused; writes to `AGENTS.md` are also refused. This
preserves governing context and mixed adapter content. These defaults do not
identify every possible secret: the supervisor must issue appropriate scope and
protected runtime/state boundaries before dispatch.

SDK file tools expose this broker through the supervisor. A cooperating lease and
pre-replacement identity check do not stop an untrusted same-user process from
renaming directories or racing the final replacement. Tool-enabled execution must
combine sandbox containment, shared target/session ownership, prompt-bound
approvals when selected, and durable journaling through the coding controller.
Grant expiry/revocation
is checked before and after lease waits and before returning data or replacing a
file; it does not interrupt a blocked filesystem syscall.

## Process sandbox invocation foundation

The internal `ProcessGrant` binds an exact immutable argument tuple to a task,
session, private staging directory and monotonic deadline, with explicit
revocation and a separate `disclose_output` flag (false by default). Commands
start with an explicit executable under `/usr/bin`; there is no shell expansion
unless the granted command itself invokes a shell. Arguments are limited to 256
entries and 16 KiB of UTF-8 bytes. A grant is supervisor-owned authority, never
constructed from saved conversation text or a model-generated request alone.

`invocation` holds the selected, verified runtime lease through the caller's
process teardown. It refuses a missing native payload; it cannot fall back to a
host executable. The invocation result includes the exact command tuple, a
protected launcher working directory, and an immutable minimal launcher
environment. The caller must use all three when starting bubblewrap; inheriting
host loader settings such as LD_PRELOAD would run code before namespace setup.
The Linux namespace layout exposes `/usr` read-only, a synthetic
`/dev`, private `/proc`, bounded tmpfs `/tmp` and `/work`, and read-only staging
at `/inputs`. A sealed copy helper prepares `/work` before the granted command.
It clears the inherited environment and sets only PATH, HOME and LANG. All
supported namespaces are isolated, further user namespaces are disabled, Linux
capabilities are dropped, and parent death terminates the sandbox. The original
workspace, runtime tree, broker state, user home and host network are not mounted
or shared. The host system toolchain remains a trusted platform prerequisite. Runtime roots
overlapping `/usr` are rejected. The caller must ensure this exposed system tree
does not contain other protected workspace, broker state or private material;
such a host layout is not qualified by this backend.

Staging must be a dedicated, exclusively owned broker-prepared snapshot, separate
from runtime and system trees. Its root is private; contents must be owned
regular files or directories, with no symlinks, hardlinked files, special modes,
shared writes, protected context or private-state entries. Inventory is limited
to 30,000 entries and 256 MiB before invocation. These are input limits, not disk,
memory or process-count limits on a running command. A caller must not mutate or
rename staging while it is being checked or used. Do not pass the original
workspace as staging. Snapshot creation must copy only content authorized for
process access and omit policy/private material; commands can create disposable
files in their private snapshot but cannot write those files back themselves.

This foundation constructs invocations; it does not dispatch public tools.
The owning broker must still prepare snapshots from file grants, supervise total
deadlines and revocation during execution, bound output and runtime resources,
authorize provider disclosure of that output, and journal any accepted workspace
writeback through the file broker. Holding a runtime lease alone supplies none
of those authorities. Current context loading happens outside this sandbox;
`AGENTS.md` and protected private directories are not copied into tool snapshots.

## Bounded sandbox process capture

The internal process broker runs a prepared `ProcessGrant` through its complete
`Invocation` (command, protected working directory and minimal environment),
retaining the selected runtime lease until the supervisor has killed and reaped
the owning process. It sends EOF on stdin. The grant's monotonic expiry covers
lease qualification and execution; the remaining time becomes the supervisor's
execution deadline. Grant revocation and caller cancellation both stop active
work. Synchronous inventory checks and lease waits remain bounded by their
existing mechanisms and are not immediately interruptible by cancellation.

The existing supervisor pipe engine supports explicit process capture alongside
its unchanged default SDK probe protocol. Capture concurrently drains stdout and
stderr, capped at 1 MiB and 64 KiB respectively. Complete output is decoded as
UTF-8 with replacement for malformed bytes. Exit zero gives `completed`; nonzero
exit gives `failed`, retaining the return code and captured diagnostics. Timeout,
cancellation and overflow give `timed_out`, `cancelled` and `output_limit` and
omit partial output. A completed command is not evidence that its requested task
was accepted or that workspace changes were committed.

`provider=True` requires `ProcessGrant.disclose_output=True` before execution.
The broker rechecks revocation and expiry after capture before releasing output.
Without disclosure authority, a caller may request local capture only and must
not subsequently send that result to a provider. Captured stdout/stderr remain
untrusted content: do not render raw terminal control sequences or interpret them
as instructions. Invalid grants or preflight failures raise without dispatch;
a caller must map these failures into its public protocol. The public coding path composes this capture with authorized snapshots,
resource isolation, safe rendering and operation journaling. Process snapshot
edits have no automatic workspace writeback; explicit file edits use the broker.

## Authorized process snapshots

The snapshot producer accepts a `FileBroker`, an existing private storage root,
an explicit nonempty tuple of file names, task/session identifiers and an optional
provider-disclosure request. It performs no recursive source discovery. Before
allocating state it checks read authority, disclosure authority when requested,
canonical names, duplicates, file/directory conflicts and protected context.
Paths are limited to 4 KiB and 128 components; the complete inventory, including
created parent directories, is limited to 30,000 entries. Storage must be separate
from the source workspace and target lease tree. The sandbox's additional runtime
and system-tree exclusions still apply before execution.

Each projection receives a new private container with `files/` and a sibling
`manifest.json`. Only `files/` is exposed to the process. The producer holds one
shared target lease across all source reads, blocking cooperating broker writes.
Reads use anchored descriptors and capture content and source mode together;
individual files remain bounded to 8 MiB and total copied content to 256 MiB.
Copies are private regular files, retaining the owner's executable bit. Nested
directories are private. Source content, modes and neighboring files are unchanged.
The shared lease does not make a transaction out of unrelated external writers;
recorded hashes identify the exact bytes actually copied.

The schema-1 manifest records task/session identifiers and `status: incomplete`
until all files and directories are flushed and current authority is rechecked.
A prepared record adds a `files` mapping from relative name to `sha256`, `size`
and `source_mode`. Failed projections remain incomplete for inspection and are
never silently replayed or promoted to prepared. The manifest is local evidence,
not executable authority or a session checkpoint.

The returned live snapshot can derive an exact process grant whose deadline
cannot exceed the source grant's deadline and whose revocation event is shared
with that grant. Output disclosure is enabled only when every copied input was
authorized for provider disclosure during creation. A local-only snapshot cannot
mint that flag through this API. Saved manifests cannot reconstruct grants;
resuming requires current authorization and reconciliation. Snapshot changes are
disposable until the broker validates and journals an explicit writeback. No
workspace writeback or automatic snapshot cleanup is implemented by this producer.

## Durable operation evidence and reconciliation

A `Journal` binds a dedicated existing private directory to bounded task/session
identifiers. It serializes appends through a persistent lock and writes canonical
schema-1 JSON records by flushing a private temporary file, renaming it into the
next sequence slot and flushing the directory. Record names are contiguous
zero-based eight-digit sequence numbers with `.json` suffixes. Each record binds
the preceding record's SHA-256. Limits are 16 KiB per record, 10,000 records and
64 MiB total. Intents and uncertain outcomes reserve one maximum-sized record
for terminal evidence; known capacity exhaustion refuses dispatch. Malformed schemas, foreign identities, gaps, unsafe record files,
noncanonical JSON and inconsistent links refuse recovery and new appends.
Recognized `.pending-<uuid>` files are retained interrupted preparations, never
interpreted as committed intents. This is protected local evidence, not a signed
log or protection against an actor allowed to rewrite its entire directory.

An intent records an operation ID, kind, request and optional checkpoint digest.
A `file_replace` request contains a canonical relative `path`, `before` SHA-256
(or null for an absent file) and expected `after` SHA-256. A `process` request
contains `argv_sha256` and `snapshot_sha256`. The checkpoint field is a
content-digest reference joined by the durable checkpoint and SDK tool bridges.
Requests do not store command text, credentials, file contents or tool output.

An intent without a terminal outcome, or with an explicit `uncertain` outcome,
blocks the next intent. The same live journal instance may finish an operation
it successfully began. A recovered operation, or one already marked uncertain,
requires an explicit reconciled outcome and an evidence digest. Terminal outcomes
cannot be replaced. File outcomes are `applied`, `not_applied` or `uncertain`;
process outcomes additionally distinguish completion, failure, cancellation,
timeout and output overflow. A reconciled file outcome describes observed state,
not proof of which process produced it. Saved journal fields never grant access,
confirm that permissions remain current, or authorize replay.

`run_recorded` joins process capture to this journal: identities and disclosure
are checked before intent, the intent is durable before dispatch, and a bounded
outcome digest is appended after teardown. Authority is checked again after that
append; late revocation, cancellation or expiry suppresses returned output while
preserving the recorded process outcome. Raw diagnostics and captured output
are not journaled. An exception after intent records uncertainty when possible
and is propagated; any journal failure stops the call. Outcome recording uses
the remaining grant time for lock acquisition, including an immediate attempt
when the execution deadline has expired. Filesystem flushes retain the existing
synchronous I/O limitation. The journal must be separate from staging, runtime
and exposed system trees. The caller still owns session exclusivity, current
authority, snapshot-digest provenance and read-only reconciliation evidence.

No journal method re-executes an operation. Recovery must inspect target state,
reconcile unfinished effects and reassess permissions before further dispatch.
Use the exclusive session facade for internal broker dispatch and the explicit
public continuation/recovery interface for SDK history. The journal alone never
restores grants or authorizes execution.

## Recorded file replacement and read-only reconciliation

`FileBroker.write_recorded` requires current read and write authority, an explicit
expected content SHA-256 (or null for absence), and a matching task/session
journal outside both workspace and target-lease trees. One exclusive target
lease covers inspection, temporary-file preparation, durable intent, replacement
and outcome recording. It does not recursively acquire an exclusive lease.
A mismatched precondition refuses before intent or replacement. Recorded existing
files are bounded to 8 MiB, matching broker reads.

New file intents also bind `root_sha256`, `before_properties` and
`after_properties`. Root identity hashes the canonical path, device and inode.
Property digests bind mode, owner, group and extended-attribute values; timestamps
are excluded. The producer records properties of the prepared replacement and
retains the existing target's properties. Temporary inherited attributes absent
from an existing target are removed before copying its attributes; unsupported
attribute changes fail before replacement. New files retain their prepared
private mode and applicable inherited attributes. The journal stores these
hashes, never the underlying attribute values.

The broker rechecks grant, root, parent-directory and target identity after intent
is durable and immediately before replacement. It flushes the target directory
before recording `applied`. Failure after intent leaves an unfinished operation,
including failures after replacement or while recording its outcome. Inspect the
journal and target rather than retrying the write. As with other broker calls,
leases coordinate cooperating writers; they do not make unrelated external
filesystem mutation transactional.

`file_recovery.reconcile` requires fresh read authority for the recorded path and
the same root identity. Under the target's shared lease it compares current
content and properties with both recorded states. Matching the desired state
records reconciled `applied`; matching the original state records reconciled
`not_applied`. A missing file can match recorded absence. A conflict, unsafe file,
changed root or missing authority preserves the unfinished record and requires
manual reconciliation. This function never replaces, removes or recreates the
target. Its result describes the observed state, not proof of which process
produced that state. It is a local recovery result, not permission to disclose
file contents to a provider.

Earlier journal file requests without root/property bindings remain readable as
historical evidence, but cannot drive this automatic comparison. The exclusive
session facade supplies lifetime ownership; checkpoint integration and explicit
public recovery compose this primitive without permitting replay.

Reconciliation rechecks the workspace root, parent directory and current leaf
identity after hashing, immediately before recording its observation. A displaced
path leaves the intent unfinished. These checks detect observed external races;
they cannot eliminate the final race with writers outside the shared lease.

## Exclusive session ownership and recovery dispatch

The internal `session_owner.lease` context takes an explicit private state root,
validated task/session identifiers, workspace, monotonic deadline and optional
live revocation event. A SHA-256 of the session identifier selects one directory
within that state root. Its exclusive lease lasts until context exit, separate
from the journal's short append/read leases. Competing owners wait only until
their deadline. Process exit releases the kernel lease; lock files are retained.
All controllers for a session must use the same configured state root.

The durable identity binds task, session and workspace path/device/inode digest.
A different task or replaced workspace cannot silently reuse the session; an
explicit branch/rebinding workflow remains required. No grants, credentials or
monotonic deadlines are restored from this record. State must remain protected
from tool processes and separate from workspace, runtime, staging and target
lease trees. The owner checks these boundaries at the applicable dispatch path.

The yielded synchronous owner is bound to its creating thread and rejects
reentrant dispatch, expired/revoked authority and use after context exit.
`inspect()` returns journal evidence; `write()` and `run()` require no unfinished
operation, then call the recorded brokers with fresh grants capped to the owner's
deadline and combined revocation. `reconcile_file()` permits the existing fresh
read-only file comparison while dispatch is blocked. Uncertain process operations
remain blocked for explicit evidence-backed reconciliation; this facade does not
infer process effects or restart them. Inspection and reconciliation do not grant
provider disclosure permission.

Lock order is session first, then runtime for process execution or target for
file operations, then the short journal lease. Child operations must not acquire
the session lease again. The state-root choice and live grant issuance belong to
the supervisor, never model input or conversation summaries. Low-level broker and
journal methods remain internal primitives, not independently exposed tools.
The coding controller composes checkpoint joins and resource qualification; public
branching and recovery commands retain this session authority boundary.

Internal caller example, using a supervisor-issued `broker` and private `state`:

```python
with lease(state, task=broker.grant.task, session=broker.grant.session,
           workspace=broker.grant.root, expires=broker.grant.expires) as owner:
    pending = [key for key, value in owner.inspect().items()
               if value["outcome"] == "uncertain"]
    # Inspect pending kinds and reconcile evidence before requesting new work.
    if not pending:
        operation = owner.write(broker, "src/new.py", b"VALUE = 1\n",
                                expected_before=None)
```

The example requires an existing granted `src` write/read scope and an absent
`src/new.py`; it does not widen either scope or overwrite an existing file.

## SDK iteration and continuable snapshots

The worker-only `sdk_iteration.iterate` drives the bundled SDK's `Agent.iter`
and node streams. It requires the active isolated payload importer, a concrete
model from the explicit provider adapter, an immutable inventory of sequential
zero-retry tools, a supplied Harness `StepStore`, and current-authority/event
callbacks. It disables agent instrumentation and agent retries. Tool functions
must be supervisor broker bridges; this internal helper does not issue grants or
make arbitrary SDK tools safe.

The caller supplies run and conversation identities, instructions, prompt and a
monotonic deadline. Defaults bound a run to eight model requests, sixteen
successful tool calls and 32,768 reported total tokens. Token accounting follows
SDK/provider reports and may detect excess only after a response. The outer async
deadline covers SDK calls and awaited callbacks; synchronous blocking code still
requires process-level supervision. External task cancellation propagates through
the SDK's context cleanup. Current authority is checked at entry, node/event
boundaries and before returning results; the supervisor must also interrupt
active work on cancellation or revocation.

Serialized stream events have a combined 1 MiB limit; final text is limited to
1 MiB and serialized input/output history to 8 MiB each. These are serialized
size checks, not a process-memory guarantee. Event bytes are SDK data for the
internal bridge, not the versioned public CLI event protocol or safe terminal
text. Tool arguments, results and conversation history require appropriate
disclosure authority before delivery to a provider or another recipient.

Harness `StepPersistence` emits run/step events, tool-effect records and
`ContinuableSnapshot` message histories through the supplied store. It is not a
full graph-state checkpoint. Completed snapshots can seed a later SDK run using
its message serializer; interrupted snapshots may contain unsettled tool calls.
The supervisor must reconcile operation evidence before supplying restored
history, including when selecting an older completed snapshot. A store's return
must mean the intended persistence acknowledgement. The isolated iteration fixture uses the SDK's in-memory store and proves
iteration/streaming, message round trips and tool-effect capture. The acknowledged
snapshot adapter supplies durable checkpoint transport; SDK tool-call/result
mapping and public resume apply the journal and disclosure checks described here.

## Durable checkpoint evidence and journal joins

`SessionOwner.save_checkpoint` stores serialized SDK message bytes with explicit
profile digest, run ID, step and complete/interrupted state. The immutable
content-addressed envelope also binds task/session and a fingerprint of the
entire validated operation journal, including terminal reconciliation records.
The trusted supervisor supplies the profile digest from its compatibility
contract; a model cannot select that identity. No credentials, grants or deadline
are restored from a checkpoint. Conversation content may itself be sensitive and
stays in protected private session state.

Each checkpoint is limited to 8 MiB of message JSON and a 16 MiB envelope. The
store limits records plus retained interrupted writes to 1,000 files and 256 MiB.
It writes a private temporary file, flushes it, renames it to its SHA-256 filename,
and flushes the directory before returning that digest. Re-saving identical
evidence validates the existing bytes and flushes the directory before
acknowledgement. Failed writes remain for inspection; the store never deletes
old conversation evidence to make room. Corrupt, linked, unsafe or over-limit
records refuse access. The envelope checks a JSON message array; SDK-specific
message validation remains the isolated worker's responsibility.

`resume_checkpoint(digest, profile=...)` requires a live owner, no uncertain
operation, a complete snapshot, matching profile identity and an unchanged
journal fingerprint. Any later intent, outcome or reconciliation makes an older
checkpoint stale. This deliberately refuses replay from an older complete
snapshot whose messages omit newer tool effects. Interrupted snapshots remain
available as evidence but never pass automatic resume. Recovery must first
reconcile effects and construct a new consistent SDK history; this store does
not synthesize tool results or silently branch across providers.

Internal `write(..., checkpoint=...)` and `run(..., checkpoint=...)` validate a
session checkpoint against the current journal before dispatch and place its
digest in the durable operation intent. An interrupted pre-tool snapshot may be
referenced for evidence, but cannot be resumed. Existing low-level callers may
omit this optional argument; the SDK mutation bridge requires the
checkpoint/operation join. Saving complete evidence while an operation is
uncertain is refused. A lost checkpoint acknowledgement does not imply a tool
operation should be retried; inspect retained immutable evidence instead.

This establishes protected local checkpoint durability and stale-history gates.
The acknowledged Harness snapshot adapter below connects this store to the worker.
SDK tool-call/result mapping and public resume use these gates. Installed coding
evidence has the bounded candidate scope recorded in the qualification reference.

## Inherited worker acknowledgement channel

`broker_rpc.Channel` uses an already connected, inherited Unix stream socket.
It never listens on a network address or discovers a peer. The supervisor chooses
the socket pair, task/session identity, immutable method allowlist, deadline and
cancellation event, then passes only the intended descriptor to its isolated
worker. Owning launch code must close unused copies in both processes. Socket
possession is a transport boundary, not a grant to read, mutate or disclose data.

Frames carry schema version 1, task/session, contiguous sequence, request/result
type and an object payload; requests also name an allowed method. A four-byte
network-order length precedes JSON. Duplicate keys, non-finite JSON numbers,
wrong identities/types/sequences, unknown methods and partial frames refuse
before handler dispatch. Limits are 16 MiB per frame, 64 MiB combined inbound
and outbound traffic per endpoint, and 10,000 exchanges. One exchange may be
outstanding. Nonblocking I/O polls deadline/cancellation at most every 50 ms.

The supervisor calls `serve_once(handler, check=...)` on its owning thread. It
checks current authority immediately before the handler and before sending the
result. The handler must validate its method-specific schema, obtain current
broker grants and finish the intended durable write before returning an
acknowledgement payload. Exceptions close the channel; exception text is not sent
to the peer. A handler may already have committed an effect when an error, lost
connection, revoked authority or output limit prevents acknowledgement.

The worker uses `request` or `request_async`; the async wrapper moves socket
waiting to a thread and closes the socket on cancellation. Any failed exchange
closes the channel, and no method retries, reconnects or replays it. Reconcile
pending effects through the session journal. These transport checks do not bound
synchronous handler execution; session deadlines and process supervision still
apply. Result payloads remain untrusted and need disclosure and rendering checks.

The acknowledged snapshot adapter and SDK file/process bridges use this channel.
The owner control socket is a separate public protocol; neither socket
substitutes for the current grants checked by its handler.

## Acknowledged Harness snapshot adapter

The isolated worker creates `sdk_persistence.checkpoint_store(finder, channel,
run_id=...)` for one explicit SDK run. It reuses Harness's in-memory StepStore
for SDK run/events/tool-effect bookkeeping and retention. Snapshot saving first stages the pinned SDK acceptance/retention decision without
changing the live view. Ignored idempotent saves send no RPC. An accepted save
serializes messages with `ModelMessagesTypeAdapter`, then awaits a
`checkpoint.save` RPC result containing one validated SHA-256 digest. Only after
that acknowledgement does it promote the snapshot into the SDK's local view.
Missing or malformed acknowledgements fail the save; malformed responses also
close the channel. No adapter method retries the request.

The supervisor's `CheckpointHandler` binds the run ID and profile digest at
construction. Worker requests supply only message JSON, step and state; attempts
to override profile, run, task or session in the payload are refused. The handler
uses the current `SessionOwner.save_checkpoint`, including its journal-frontier,
uncertainty, size, durability and authority checks. Use it only through the
inherited channel's owning-thread dispatch and current-authority callback.

The adapter keeps two recent snapshots per run, plus Harness's required newest
complete/interrupted retention entries. `last_checkpoint` identifies the newest
accepted local snapshot; a superseded idempotent SDK save cannot replace that
handle. Staging relies on Harness’s private `_snapshots` and
`_snapshot_key_high_water` structures; fork upgrades must requalify that boundary
against same-object duplicates, older keys, retention and failed acknowledgements.
Saves are serialized within the adapter. The supervisor retains immutable checkpoint records independently of
worker memory. Instantiate a new adapter for a new run; a mismatched run ID is
refused at registration and snapshot saving.

Installed qualification uses a deterministic tool-free SDK run, persists its
actual serialized history through a separate worker process, and verifies the
same bytes through a fresh session owner. A failed acknowledgement does not
promote the local snapshot or checkpoint handle. This adapter durably saves
conversation snapshots; SDK run/event/tool-effect metadata remains process-local.
Durable broker tool-call/result mapping and explicit recovery history
reconstruction are supplied by the owners below; no automatic resume is enabled.

## SDK file tools and durable tool-call identity

The isolated `sdk_file_tools.file_tools` factory exposes only sequential,
zero-retry `read_file` and `write_file` tools. Both delegate to `FileHandler` on
the supervisor's owning thread; neither opens workspace files in the worker.
Reads return granted UTF-8 text and its SHA-256 and require current file-read
**and provider-disclosure** authority. The owner rechecks the bound file-read/disclosure grant after decoding and hashing
the response, as well as session authority. Binary files need a separate image
or binary interface; this text tool refuses invalid UTF-8.

Before a write request, the worker serializes the native live SDK history and
awaits an interrupted pre-tool checkpoint. It then sends the path, replacement
text, expected content hash (null means absence), checkpoint digest and SDK tool
call ID. The supervisor binds its configured run/profile and `write_file` name,
hashes the canonical broker arguments, and uses the fresh file broker grant.
Extra identity/authority fields in the request are refused.

The operation intent optionally records `tool_call` with `run_id`, `call_id`,
`name` and `arguments_sha256`, alongside its checkpoint reference. Such records
require a checkpoint and bounded validated identifiers. The journal rejects a
second intent for the same `(run_id, call_id)`, even after the first operation
completed or was reconciled. Changing arguments does not make that call ID new.
Existing journal records without tool metadata remain readable. This is a replay
barrier, not permission to dispatch saved calls or infer their outcomes.

`SessionOwner.write` checks the referenced checkpoint's run/profile and current
journal frontier before invoking the recorded broker. File preconditions, unsafe
paths, authority loss and journal conflicts still fail before replacement. The
result reports the operation ID and `applied` only after the broker's durable
outcome. A later SDK snapshot contains the returned tool result and the new
journal frontier; an older snapshot remains stale. Read-only calls do not create
mutation intents; their message/result history is captured by Harness snapshots.

The installed deterministic fixture exercises SDK read → hash-conditional write
→ journal/tool-call/checkpoint linkage → settled history, all across the inherited
worker channel. Process recipes are qualified separately below. Durable tool-result recovery and optional public approvals are separate
contracts composed by the current run interface; this fixture alone does not
qualify every recovery or interactive scenario.

## SDK process recipes and isolated test commands

`ProcessHandler` extends file/checkpoint dispatch with `process.run`. The trusted
supervisor supplies up to 64 named immutable `Recipe` values, each binding exact
argument tuple, explicit input-file tuple and positive time limit. The worker
can select a recipe name and provide its checkpoint/call ID; it cannot override
arguments, input files, runtime paths or authority in that request. Commands use
an explicit `/usr/bin` executable. A shell is available only if its exact argv
was separately granted in the recipe.

Within one owned session operation, the handler checks checkpoint run/profile
and journal freshness, rejects already-recorded SDK call IDs, and verifies state
separation. It caps the recipe deadline to the session and fresh file grant before
projecting inputs. Every selected file requires read and provider-disclosure
authority. The private snapshot producer preserves the original workspace;
process changes affect only that disposable snapshot and are not written back.
The process intent binds checkpoint, tool-call identity, approved recipe/argv/
input/time digest and actual snapshot-manifest digest before dispatch.

The existing sealed-runtime sandbox launcher and bounded process supervisor run
the recipe, capture its process outcome and finish the journal after teardown.
The handler returns operation ID, status, return code and bounded output, with
current output-grant and session checks before returning content. Cancellation,
timeout and output-limit outcomes retain the broker's suppression of partial
output. Failures after intent remain subject to reconciliation; the SDK bridge
never retries an uncertain call.

The isolated `sdk_process_tool.process_tool` exposes sequential zero-retry
`run_command(name)`. It shares native pre-tool checkpoint acknowledgement with the
file tools. Installed deterministic qualification performs read → conditional
write → named test command in the actual qualified namespace → settled SDK
checkpoint. The test runs against a freshly projected copy of the updated file.
This is an internal recipe capability, not unrestricted shell permission or
public approval UI. Public execution composes hard resource qualification,
durable result recovery and supervisor/control handling; each retains its own
authority and evidence boundaries.

## Delegated resource-group lifecycle

`resource_group(parent, Limits(...))` creates one random child under an explicit
owned cgroup v2 delegation. The parent must already enable `cpu`, `memory` and
`pids`; this API does not configure the host, change parent controls, or reuse an
existing group. It refuses other filesystem paths and symlinked parents.

Defaults are 512 MiB memory, zero swap, 64 tasks and 100 percent of one CPU.
Memory is configurable from 16 MiB through 16 GiB, tasks from 4 through 512,
and CPU quota from 1 through 800 percent. All limits are integers; CPU uses a
100 ms quota period. Settings include group OOM termination and are read back
before a membership descriptor is exposed. The trusted launcher must join through
that descriptor before starting any untrusted payload, close it before exec,
and keep cgroup controls inaccessible to the payload. A changed limit refuses
new membership handles.

Context exit marks the handle expired, writes `cgroup.kill`, waits up to five
seconds for an empty group, then removes only the newly created child. Failed
teardown is an error and retains the group for reconciliation; it is not a
successful cancellation claim. Failed setup never yields a membership handle.
These interfaces follow the [kernel cgroup v2 contract](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html).

This module supplies resource ownership and lifecycle. The sealed launcher uses
the pre-exec membership integration described below. Writable sandbox storage
is bounded by the disposable command storage contract. Availability
of controller names alone does not qualify a host or enable public execution.

Bounded Linux kernel qualification exercised a 64 MiB memory group that killed a
128 MiB allocation, an eight-task group that refused another fork, and teardown
of live descendants which had created separate sessions. CPU quota was verified
by control-file readback; CPU throttling behavior was not measured in this test.
These results qualify this lifecycle on the tested host, not every Linux host
or an installed public agent command.

## Resource membership before sandbox dispatch

An internal `ProcessGrant` can supply an explicit `resource_parent` and `Limits`.
The sandbox invocation creates the limited group while holding the selected
runtime lease, then runs that release's isolated Python `resource_exec` module.
The supervisor inherits only the explicit membership descriptor. The trusted
child writes its own PID before executing the sealed sandbox binary and closes
the descriptor first. Failed membership prevents sandbox or payload execution;
there is no race with a parent moving an already-running payload into a group.

Resource-group teardown encloses process supervision. The broker checks deadline,
revocation and output authority again after teardown, so cleanup cannot turn an
expired grant into disclosed output. Group cleanup failure propagates as failure;
recorded execution retains uncertainty rather than returning a success result.
The calling process needs migration authority in the delegated hierarchy. No
permission repair, parent-controller change or automatic service is performed.

Omitting `resource_parent` preserves the existing internal namespace qualification
path; it is not a fully resource-qualified public run. Public dispatch requires [tool preflight](#provider-free-tool-preflight). Disposable
filesystem integration removes writable host snapshot mounts; omitting the
resource parent is never a qualified public path.

## Bounded disposable command storage

Every sandbox invocation mounts its broker-prepared host snapshot read-only at
`/inputs`. The selected sealed release supplies a standard-library-only bootstrap,
run with isolated system Python, which copies regular files and directories into
`/work` before executing the exact granted command. Copying rejects symlinks,
hardlinks, special files, scan failures and changed file identities, with the
existing 30,000-entry and 256 MiB input limits. Owner execute permission survives;
copy errors prevent command execution.

`/work` is a 512 MiB tmpfs by default; `/tmp` is a separate 64 MiB tmpfs. Trusted
`ProcessGrant.work_bytes` and `temporary_bytes` can each select an integer size
from 16 MiB through 1 GiB. Filling a filesystem fails the write instead of growing
host snapshot storage. The sandbox root is remounted read-only. Command edits
and generated files disappear with the namespace; edits to the original workspace
still go through the file broker. There is no process-result file writeback.

These filesystem capacities do not replace aggregate memory, CPU and task limits.
`ProcessHandler` accepts supervisor-owned `resource_parent` and `Limits` and forwards
them to the snapshot process grant; model requests cannot override them. Public [tool preflight](#provider-free-tool-preflight) qualifies the selected
native payload, namespace, delegation and pre-exec membership before any
provider request. Internal calls
without a resource parent remain ineligible for a fully qualified public run.

Installed qualification used 16 MiB filesystems and verified `ENOSPC` for both,
read-only refusal for `/inputs` and the namespace root, and unchanged host input
after editing `/work`. The same artifact passed normal execution, a memory-limit
failure and cancellation with suppressed output under a delegated resource group.

## Provider-free tool preflight

`qualified_tools(runtimes, scratch, resource_parent, task=..., session=...,
expires=..., limits=...)` runs the installed sealed sandbox before yielding to
its caller. Use this context before provider dispatch and keep it open for the
run. It retains the selected runtime lease, exercises actual cgroup membership,
and probes mount, network, PID and user namespace separation from the supervisor.
The probe checks read-only host inputs and root, absent cgroup control mounts,
only a loopback network interface, bounded filesystem capacities and unchanged
host input. Failure, cancellation, malformed results or diagnostics refuse the
caller body; no provider, credential or SDK initialization is part of this API.

Scratch must be an explicit existing private directory separate from runtime,
system and delegation paths. Preflight creates and removes only its temporary
synthetic fixture, with a probe deadline capped at 15 seconds and the task expiry.
It does not repair host permissions, configure a delegation, or create provider
configuration. The selected runtime lease remains held after probe cleanup.

The live `ToolQualification` binds task/session, selected release, delegation,
resource limits, deadline and revocation. `bind(grant)` applies those settings to
freshly authorized process grants and combines their revocation with the context
lifetime. Storage requests above the qualified 512 MiB work / 64 MiB temporary
capacities are refused. `run(grant)` uses that same runtime root. Leaving the
context invalidates both the result and previously bound grants. The result is
not a persisted permission; current file/disclosure/session authority remains
separate and every process still recreates and verifies its limited group.

The coding controller enters this preflight before starting its provider worker
and retains qualification for the run. Installed fixture acceptance remains
bounded to the artifact, host and scenarios actually exercised.

## Broker service in the worker supervisor

`supervise(..., broker=(channel, handler, check))` services an inherited `Channel`
inside the existing main-thread selector loop alongside bounded worker stdout
and stderr. The broker handler and authority callback execute on that thread,
so session ownership does not move to a background thread. The channel's I/O
deadline is capped to the supervisor deadline and its cancellation includes the
supervisor cancellation source and worker liveness. Worker exit interrupts
partial frames even if another peer descriptor remains open. Cancellation or expiry while reading a partial
frame stops supervision and discards output.

Clean channel EOF unregisters its descriptor. Worker exit also disables broker
service, including when the controller still holds a duplicate peer descriptor.
Each dispatch checks that the worker is still alive and invokes the current
authority callback. Other protocol/handler failures propagate after worker
teardown; they do not fabricate a successful terminal outcome. The caller owns
channel closure and evaluates the durable operation journal after uncertainty.

Handlers remain trusted synchronous code: bind their operation deadlines and
revocation to the same task limits before calling the supervisor. Channel I/O
bounds cannot interrupt an arbitrary blocking handler. The SDK tool handlers use
the separately bounded file/process brokers. The coding controller combines this service with preflight, session authority
and terminal validation.

## Installed coding worker exchange

The internal installed `coding_worker` uses isolated Python and the verified SDK
payload. Its arguments contain only the inherited channel descriptor, task,
session and monotonic deadline. `run.start` retrieves an explicit profile,
credential, run ID, prompt, instructions, optional reconciled history and usage
limits from the supervisor. Credentials are not placed in process arguments,
inherited environment, stdout or error diagnostics. The worker uses the existing
explicit SDK model adapter and final-send transport; it does not discover a model,
provider or credential. Its generic failure diagnostic excludes exception text.

`CodingHandler` binds that request to the tool broker's profile digest and run ID.
It permits one start, refuses dispatch before start or after a reported result,
and acknowledges native SDK stream events through `stream.event`. Events are
untrusted data for the caller's safe renderer; limits are 1 MiB total and 10,000
events. Prompt and instructions are each capped at 128 KiB; restored history at
8 MiB; the complete request at 12 MiB. Accepted request/tool/reported-token limits
are bounded integers, passed directly to SDK iteration with implicit retries off.

`run.finish` carries output, reported usage and a checkpoint reference. The
supervisor requires that checkpoint to belong to the current run and pass the
current owner's complete-history/profile/journal-frontier resume checks before
acknowledging it. Usage is bounded report data, not authority. The worker then
emits only a small completion receipt on stdout. The controller must require a
successful process outcome and validate that receipt with `terminal()` against
the acknowledged result. A result reported before process failure is insufficient.

The owning controller must first qualify tools, authorize context/history and
provider disclosure, and bind operation deadlines and cancellation to the task.
This worker exchange supplies no public approval policy or recovery synthesis.
The public run command and recovery owner compose those requirements.

Installed deterministic qualification exercised four streamed Chat Completions
requests: read, conditional edit, sandbox test and final answer. All captured
requests carried the framework-resolved user-agent, and the final checkpoint was
read by a fresh owner. The [Responses contract](LSCLI.md#responses-coding-qualification) covers that
interface separately. Neither fixture alone establishes the complete coding/recovery suite.

## Supervisor-owned coding controller

`run_coding(paths, payload, authority, files, recipes, limits=..., on_event=...)`
combines the internal components. `CodingGrant` is an explicit task/session grant
for the digest of the complete noncredential request: profile, context, restored
history and usage limits. Credential rotation does not change that digest. This
grant authorizes disclosure of the supplied context; it does not authorize
reading files to assemble context. File access and file-content disclosure still
require the separate `FileGrant`. Neither grant is reconstructed from saved text.

`RunPaths` identifies runtime, sessions, target leases, snapshots, scratch and
resource delegation. Those paths must be absolute and separate from each other,
the workspace and exposed system tree. The controller checks the disclosure
digest of its retained request copy and file task/session first. It acquires
session ownership, refuses uncertain operations, then qualifies and retains the
runtime before starting the worker. Supplied history requires an explicit `resume` checkpoint and must exactly
match its currently resumable bytes and profile; there is no implicit replay.

Context, file and caller cancellation are combined, and the earliest grant expiry
bounds preflight, session, channel, worker and tool operations. The controller
checks current authority around stream delivery and dispatch. Success requires
successful worker exit, matching acknowledged receipt, and another current
checkpoint validation. Non-success process outcomes return no captured data;
revocation and expiry also suppress data. Other failures propagate for the caller
to classify and reconcile, without automatic retries.

The event sink is trusted synchronous controller code and must remain bounded.
This API does not itself provide an interactive renderer, approvals, steering or
synthesize missing tool results after a crash. The public run interface supplies rendering, optional approvals and steering;
the recovery owner supplies explicit reconstruction from verified receipts.

Installed controller qualification completed the deterministic read/edit/test
flow and verified the framework user-agent on all four Chat Completions requests.
An altered context was refused without another request. Cancellation at the first
stream event stopped a second run after one request, returned no result data,
and left the workspace unchanged. These are bounded internal controller checks;
interactive acceptance and crash windows beyond the
[documented installed checks](LSCLI_QUALIFICATION.md#installed-controller-crash-qualification)
remain separate requirements.

## Durable tool results for local recovery

File-write and process RPC handlers flush a private immutable receipt after
journal settlement and before returning the tool result. Each receipt binds the
session/task, provider profile, pre-tool checkpoint, SDK run/call identity and
argument digest to the exact result. Process stdout/stderr are retained only when
their hash matches the settled journal evidence. Storage uses the checkpoint
store's atomic write/fsync and private regular-file checks, in a separate
`tool-results` directory: at most 1,000 records/pending files, 256 MiB total, and
4 MiB per serialized receipt. It never prunes sessions automatically.

The internal `tool_results.recover(owner, operation, profile=...)` reads that
receipt under a fresh exclusive session owner and validates the journal and
checkpoint identity again. For example, after losing a file-write acknowledgement,
inspect the operation journal, obtain its operation ID, and recover its recorded
result. This does not write the file again or claim its current contents still
match the historical result. A later workspace edit remains untouched. Receipts
are local evidence; sending their contents to a provider still requires current
explicit disclosure authority.

Missing, damaged, conflicting, foreign-profile or uncertain-operation evidence
fails recovery. A crash after journal settlement but before receipt persistence
can leave a settled operation with no recoverable output; the operation must not
be repeated to recreate that output. A receipt alone does not make the interrupted
pre-tool checkpoint resumable: existing frontier and complete-history checks
remain enforced. Public recovery requires explicit task/session selection. Saved data carries
no grants, approvals or authority.

## Native history reconstruction boundary

The isolated SDK worker's `sdk_recovery.reconstruct` accepts bounded serialized
history and supervisor-verified receipts. It matches unresolved tool-call IDs and
names, verifies file arguments or the original named process recipe's digest,
and appends native SDK tool-return parts in call order. Existing messages remain
in the new history; the original checkpoint is never overwritten. Missing,
duplicate, extra or mismatched receipts, changed recipes, ambiguous call IDs and
unsupported pending tools fail without dispatch. Both input and reconstructed
history are limited to 8 MiB; at most 256 receipts are accepted.

A deterministic SDK continuation test consumes the reconstructed file-write and
process results and produces a final answer without registering or executing any
tools. This qualifies message reconstruction only. The helper does not verify a
journal on its own, restore permission, contact a provider, persist a checkpoint
or bypass the current frontier check. Supervisor recovery must first join the
original checkpoint to journal history and receipts, then validate and save a new
checkpoint under current session authority. Any subsequent provider disclosure
requires a new explicit grant covering the resulting history.

## Supervisor recovery acceptance

`recovery.recover_checkpoint(owner, runtimes, checkpoint, profile=..., recipes=...)`
requires a fresh live session owner. The journal proves that the interrupted
checkpoint's frontier is an exact settled prefix of its current hash chain.
Every subsequent operation must be settled and have a recoverable receipt for
the same profile and run. Foreign prefixes, prior uncertainty, missing receipts
and unrelated subsequent operations fail before reconstruction.

The controller holds the selected installed runtime lease while an isolated local
worker reconstructs native history. The exchange binds an exact input digest;
the controller verifies unchanged original messages and exactly the recorded tool
returns, with no added instructions or authority-bearing metadata. It requires a
successful worker process and matching completion receipt, then rechecks the
journal frontier before saving a new complete checkpoint. The original checkpoint
and operation journal remain unchanged. Current deadline/revocation checks apply
through dispatch, receipt validation and checkpoint acceptance.

This provider-free recovery does not execute tools, rerun processes, synthesize
missing output or restore saved permissions. The returned checkpoint may be read
through the existing resume API. A coding continuation must separately authorize
its exact recovered history through a fresh disclosure grant and qualify current
tool access. The public run command exposes this through `--recover-from`.

## Compaction worker foundation

The worker-only `sdk_compaction.compact` adapter uses the pinned Harness
`SummarizingCompaction` cutoff and `compact_now` primitive. Its summary request
uses the shared explicit model transport, streaming text with no tools, zero
retries, one request, caller token/deadline limits, and a 64 KiB summary bound.
Reported summary usage is returned to the supervisor for accounting. Output tokens
are requested at `min(token_limit, 4096)`; the total token limit is checked against
provider-reported usage and cannot guarantee a provider's billing or tokenizer.

The SDK chooses a tail boundary that does not split tool calls from results.
The adapter preserves that native tail and original system context, but demotes
the generated summary to historical user context with no authority. It refuses
an empty summary, unsupported media/reasoning in the summarized prefix, no
compactable prefix, or a result that does not reduce serialized history. Input
and output histories are each capped at 8 MiB. Original bytes are not mutated.
This adapter has deterministic Chat Completions and Responses qualification. The
[protected compaction command](LSCLI.md#compact-a-checkpoint) adds durable supervisor
acceptance and the explicit checkpoint workflow.

## Direct completion contract foundation

The provider-free `completion_contract` module defines version-one requests for
`localsetup llm complete`. The protected command and worker use this contract;
QC compatibility uses the same protected worker.
A request is at most 1 MiB, rejects duplicate keys and unknown fields, and binds
its model to the selected explicit profile. Example:

```json
{
  "interface_version": 1,
  "model": "fixture-model",
  "deadline_seconds": 120,
  "max_attempts": 1,
  "max_output_tokens": 8192,
  "input": {"evidence_id": "fixture", "facts": []},
  "output_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {"ok": {"type": "boolean"}},
    "required": ["ok"],
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

`schema_mode` defaults to `native`, which requires the profile's `native_schema`
capability; explicit `validate_only` requests local validation without claiming
provider-side enforcement. Both modes validate returned JSON locally. Schemas
use Draft 2020-12, at most 64 nested containers, and local JSON Pointer references
only; external references, schema identifiers and unresolved targets refuse.
The canonical Draft 2020-12 `$schema` declaration is allowed. Schema format names
are annotations, not additional format checks. JSON output is limited to 1 MiB;
malformed/duplicate-key output and schema rejection remain distinct outcomes.

The deadline must be positive and at most 3600 seconds; output tokens are limited
to 1–1,000,000. `max_attempts` must be exactly 1: this delivery does not implement
the proposal's optional retry loop. Optional `reasoning_effort` accepts `none`,
`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high` or `xhigh`; each requested value requires a
matching `reasoning:VALUE` capability in the selected profile. For example, `reasoning:high` permits `high` but not `low`.
Declarations record operator-qualified endpoint/model support; they do not prove
live compatibility. Omitted effort remains omitted from provider requests.

The result envelope contains `interface_version`, `status`, `data`, `model`,
`usage`, `request_id`, `attempts` and a stable `reason` code equal to its status.
Failure data is always null. Exit codes are: succeeded 0, invalid_request 2,
unavailable 3, refused 4, incomplete 5, malformed 6, schema_rejected 7,
rate_limited 8, transport_failed 9, uncertain 10, provider_error 11,
output_limit 12, deadline 124 and cancelled 130. Provider messages, prompts and
credentials must not become reason strings. The protected completion worker applies bounded transport, status normalization
and final acceptance; these result codes do not authorize tools or retries.

## Direct-model worker adapter foundation

`sdk_completion.complete` uses the SDK's direct `Model.request` API inside the
isolated importer, with empty function/native/output tool lists, one attempt and
no Agent loop. It uses the shared explicit transport and native schema output
when requested; validate-only output still passes local schema validation.
Optional reasoning effort requires its exact per-value profile capability before
dispatch. The SDK sends `reasoning_effort` for Chat Completions and
`reasoning.effort` for Responses, without adding undeclared options.
The protected command and QC wrapper use this adapter.

Before SDK response normalization, a completion-only transport guard caps the
identity-encoded body at 1 MiB plus 64 KiB of protocol overhead. It requests
identity encoding and rejects compressed responses before reading their bodies.
Other coding and compaction transport behavior is unchanged. The guard inspects
raw completion status and refusals, preventing SDK normalization from converting
an unfinished result into success. Responses reasoning items are skipped and
output text is joined in message/content order. Hosted tools and non-text outputs
are rejected; no tools are executed. A bounded ASCII `x-request-id` and available
input/output token counts are retained, without raw provider diagnostics.

The effective deadline begins at adapter entry and includes provider processing,
local validation and envelope construction. Authority is checked again before
success is returned. Network connection failures are distinguished from uncertain
transport interruptions; neither is retried. The protected supervisor bounds synchronous processing and owns final acceptance
through the [protected command](LSCLI.md#tool-free-completion-command).
Deterministic fixtures cover both APIs, success/schema/refusal/incomplete/malformed
results, rate limits, missing credentials, connection/read failures, oversized
responses, revocation and deadline expiry during validation. This qualifies the
adapter path; it does not establish compatibility with every live endpoint.

Deterministic direct-completion fixtures qualify serialization of all six declared
reasoning values on both APIs. Every undeclared value refuses before HTTP, and
requests without an effort omit the parameter. Existing profile fields and
capability defaults remain unchanged; adding a capability changes the profile's
identity, so existing history requires the usual explicit compatibility branch.

## Protected completion worker

`completion_run.run` supervises the direct-model adapter in the selected sealed
runtime. It freezes the request/profile payload before checking its noncredential
disclosure digest against a live task/session grant. Credentials cross only the
inherited owner socket. The worker has no tools, workspace access grants or
inherited credential environment. This internal boundary creates no sessions or
configuration; the [public completion command](LSCLI.md#tool-free-completion-command)
delegates through it.

The parent caps worker lifetime by both the grant and request deadlines, including
schema validation in the worker. It checks current authority at RPC boundaries
and before final acceptance. The worker returns a versioned outcome and digest;
the parent requires the matching RPC acknowledgement, successful process exit and
stdout digest, then validates bounded envelope fields. Failure outcomes contain
no data or provider diagnostic strings. A structured model failure can therefore
be an accepted worker result; successful process exit alone never means a
successful model completion.

Schema evaluation stays inside the deadline-bound worker; the parent validates
protocol shape and trusts the verified installed adapter's schema result.
Revocation, worker failure, an inconsistent receipt or deadline exhaustion prevents
acceptance. The command maps execution failures to bounded public outcomes and
never replays a possibly delivered request automatically. Runtime use locks remain
held through worker teardown. QC compatibility uses the same protected worker.

## Read-only runtime lease primitive

Runtime diagnostics can acquire an existing shared runtime lease with
`runtime_use(root, create=False)`. This internal mode opens the established lock
read-only and never creates a root or lock. A missing lock reports incomplete
setup; it does not repair the installation. Exclusive upgrades still exclude
these readers, and existing ownership, link, permission and inode checks apply.
The noncreating mode cannot take an exclusive lease. Existing execution and
installation callers retain their current lock-creation behavior. This primitive
alone does not qualify runtime readiness or change the doctor result.

## Release-bound registration dispatch primitive

The internal `registered_cli` dispatcher is the protected target of receipt-backed
PATH registration; command and receipt creation belong to the registration owner. It accepts an
explicit absolute runtime root and release digest, verifies the current selected
runtime through a noncreating lease, and requires its Python executable and
module to come from that installed release. The launcher must use the protected
Python with `-I -B`; source-checkout execution is refused.

A changed selected digest makes the registration stale, including for setup or
help. Recovery uses the verified selected release's full entrypoint path, such as
`/path/to/runtimes/RELEASE_SHA256/venv/bin/lscli`; no shell code parses selection
JSON or follows an unchecked path. Registration writing and refresh use their separate owners; the dispatcher
alone does not establish that a PATH command exists.

The selection lease ends before CLI dispatch so setup can obtain an exclusive
upgrade/reselection lease. Each operation retains its existing leases and
revalidation; concurrent selection changes follow those operation contracts.
The bound root becomes the default only for commands supporting `--runtime-root`,
and reaches forwarded worker arguments. Explicit user overrides remain explicit;
profile-only setup, sessions, profiles, and help receive no extraneous runtime
flag. This introduces no ambient environment-based runtime selection and grants
no workspace, provider, or process authority.

## Fresh registration plan primitive

The internal `registration_plan.plan` builds a deterministic fresh-command
specification without creating a bin directory, command, receipt, or runtime
lock. It verifies the selected installed inventory and requires its dispatcher
bytes to match the current planner's qualified dispatcher. A different dispatcher
must use its corresponding planner; inspection does not execute candidate code.

The specification binds the absolute target, runtime root, release digest, and
SHA-256 of the fully quoted `/bin/sh` launcher. That launcher invokes only the
protected release Python with `-I -B` and the release-bound dispatcher. Targets
inside the protected runtime tree are refused. Existing command files and links
are conflicts even if they contain a managed-looking marker; adoption and refresh
require the separate ownership writer.

PATH inspection is limited to 256 entries and 64 KiB. It refuses an executable
with the same command name before the intended bin directory. A bin directory
absent from PATH yields `ready: false`, not an effective registration claim.
Empty or relative PATH entries retain their current-directory meaning; the tool
does not edit PATH or shell startup files. The [public registration interface](LSCLI.md#public-fresh-command-registration)
uses this prerequisite without granting runtime execution authority.

## Receipt-backed fresh registration owner

The internal `registration_owner` adds create-only publication to the planner.
Its plan binds the complete specification with `plan_sha256`; apply requires
that digest, an effective PATH position, and unchanged runtime selection. It
takes the runtime shared lease before the bin directory exclusive lease, then
rechecks the plan. Existing commands and registration metadata are conflicts;
managed-looking text does not establish ownership.

Publication writes a private pending intent first, then a mode-700 launcher and
mode-600 receipt. Each fully written, fsynced temporary file is linked into place
without replacing an existing target. Successful completion removes the pending
intent. An interruption can leave directories, the coordination lock, temporary
files, or an incomplete publication. A pending intent blocks fresh replay even
when a launcher or final receipt exists. Inspect retained evidence before recovery;
this primitive does not automatically replay or remove uncertain writes.

Read-only status reports missing, unmanaged, incomplete, modified, registered,
or stale state under an existing shared bin lease. An existing directory without
that lock reports `coordination_unavailable` and creates nothing. Unsafe files,
malformed receipts, busy locks, and invalid runtimes raise errors rather than
asserting readiness. The bin lease ends before inspecting the runtime, avoiding
inverted lock order. Registered status checks receipt/content and selected release
at inspection time; it does not requalify current PATH precedence or authorize
execution. Receipt hashes detect inconsistency, not malicious same-user forgery.

Focused filesystem fixtures qualify fresh publication, modified-command
preservation, interrupted writes, plan changes, and bin lease exclusion. They
mock runtime selection and do not establish installed launcher behavior. See
[owned refresh/recovery](#owned-refresh-and-explicit-reconciliation-primitives) and
the separate [installed candidate checks](LSCLI_QUALIFICATION.md#installed-setup-and-registration-qualification).

## Owned refresh and explicit reconciliation primitives

The internal `registration_refresh` owner refreshes an intact receipt-backed
launcher to the selected qualified release within its recorded runtime root.
The receipt must retain its original canonical bytes; even whitespace edits are
refused before mutation so recovery never loses the accepted before state.
Its read-only plan binds the before/after receipts and hashes of observed command,
receipt and pending state. Apply requires that plan digest and rechecks under
runtime-then-bin leases. Modified launchers, unknown receipts, ineffective PATH
placement, or an existing pending operation prevent refresh.

Before replacement, the owner retains the old mode-600 receipt in a
content-addressed previous-receipt file and records the before/after intent.
The receipt includes the old launcher bytes and release identity. Replacement
uses fully written private temporary regular files and atomic rename, preserving
the required launcher/receipt modes. It never modifies runtime artifacts,
profiles, sessions, or unrelated bin contents. These leases coordinate LocalSetup
writers; the protected-directory and same-user trust assumptions still apply.

An interrupted operation remains pending. Fresh registration and refresh refuse
to replay it. Explicit `recovery_plan` reads and classifies the observed files:
each must match the recorded before or after state (or absence for an interrupted
fresh registration). Unknown edits stop reconciliation. The intended release must
still be selected and qualified. `recover` requires the newly reviewed recovery
plan digest, rechecks the observations under leases, and finishes only the known
remaining replacements before removing the pending intent. Repeated interruptions
require another observation and reviewed plan. This is an explicit new recovery
operation, not automatic replay.

These internal primitives also reconcile an interrupted fresh registration.
They do not select an older runtime or discard modified files. If selection has
changed again, inspect the records and use the existing explicit runtime recovery
procedure to select the intended verified release before reconciling. Old receipt
backups remain available after success. Fixture tests cover refreshed ownership,
retained backup bytes, interrupted launcher/receipt replacement, fresh pending
publication, digest mismatch, and custom edits after recovery planning. Runtime
selection is mocked; installed qualification remains a separate gate.

## Supervised registration binding

Internal supervised callers resolve an owned registration into its canonical
protected Python dispatcher argv. Resolution checks the private canonical
receipt, unchanged launcher, absence of pending registration work, explicit
runtime-root match, current selected release, and qualified dispatcher bytes.
It uses existing noncreating leases and performs no repair or selection changes.

The caller executes the resolved dispatcher rather than rereading the mutable
registration shell script. An intervening edit cannot substitute that script as
the command. The dispatcher rechecks selection at launch and refuses a stale
release. Parent-side resolution releases its leases before child dispatch; it
does not reserve selection indefinitely or establish task permissions. The
coding runtime still owns its execution lease and sandbox/provider preflight.

This internal binding is a prerequisite for typed heartbeat profiles; it does
not activate a heartbeat, provide credentials, or grant workspace disclosure.
