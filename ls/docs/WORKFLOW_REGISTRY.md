## Usage

- Agents load the workflow package when a user invokes a workflow ID, package name, or alias.
- Workflow packages install into the managed skill library because every package includes a valid `SKILL.md`.
- Required skills listed in `workflow.yaml` are automatically selected when a workflow's pack is selected.
- Historical publish workflow pointers are retired; use `ls-github-publishing-workflow` plus `ls-automatic-versioning`.
