## Skills And Workflow Packages At A Glance

LocalSetup installs both capability skills and workflow packages into the managed package library. Keep [WORKFLOW_PACKAGES.md](WORKFLOW_PACKAGES.md) as the canonical reference for:

- source layout and runtime shape
- installer behavior and dependency pull-in
- validation and generated workflow docs

## Core Workflows

| Page | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Workflow registry](WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md) | Named workflows, aliases, impact expectations, and when to use them. |
| [Workflow quick reference](WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md) | Agent-facing workflow shortcuts and composite pipelines. |
| [Decision tree workflow](DECISION_TREE_WORKFLOW.md) | Reverse-prompt planning: one question, options, preferred choice, rationale. |
| [PRD schema and external agent guide](PRD_SCHEMA_EXTERNAL_AGENT_GUIDE.md) | Spec format, outcome template, and external-agent handoff fields. |
| [Git traceability](GIT_TRACEABILITY.md) | How PRDs, specs, outcomes, and commits stay connected. |
| [Tmux ops managed workflow](ops/tmux-ops-managed.md) | Human and agent guide for managed tmux sessions, sudo probe, run IDs, logs, status, and cancellation. |
| [Tmux ops remote guide](ops/tmux-ops-remote.md) | How to run human-visible ops when tmux is on another host. |

## Skills

| Page | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Skills and rules](SKILLS_AND_RULES.md) | How always-loaded context, skills, and adapters fit together. |

Registered capability highlights:

- `ls-nodejs-nextjs`: Node.js/Next.js/React runbook for package-manager, build, migration, debugging, testing, security, deployment, and current-version verification.
- `ls-github-starredrepos`: GitHub starred repository archive workflow for authenticated context checks, dry-run sync, repo scouting, metadata snapshots, and guarded publish flows.
- `ls-shadcn-ui`: shadcn/ui component workflow for setup, components, CLI/MCP, registry, theming, forms, aliases, Radix/Base UI, updates, and troubleshooting.
- `ls-typescript-code-quality`: TypeScript/TSX code quality, tsconfig, typed ESLint or Biome config, Node TypeScript scripts, and TypeScript-heavy framework code.
- `ls-ui-browser-debugging`: UI review and browser-driven debugging workflow for Chrome DevTools MCP, Playwright MCP/CLI, browser ownership, evidence capture, minimal fixes, and durable UI regression tests.
- `ls-requesting-code-review`: Use when requesting code review before merge or after substantial changes; provide focused requirements, diff range, and severity-calibrated review instructions.
- `ls-omniroute-update`: OmniRoute update reporting for upstream skill discovery, LocalSetup comparison, provenance metadata, and report-first import/update/removal planning.

## Agent Q Transport

Agent Q is the bidirectional handoff layer for PRD/spec exchange over file_drop or mail with sealed payloads, registry checks, and ledgered outcomes.
