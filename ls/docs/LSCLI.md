# LSCli bootstrap and diagnostics

LSCli is the integrated CLI for LocalSetup (LS). Its command is `lscli`; the
existing framework command and Python distribution remain `localsetup`.
The current bootstrap provides help, version output, and read-only diagnostics.
Agent execution is not yet available. A verified SDK payload alone does not
establish protected runtime, sandbox, provider, or supervisor readiness.

```bash
lscli --help
lscli --version
lscli doctor
lscli doctor --format json
```

Help and version return 0. Doctor currently returns 3 because execution gates
remain unavailable; payload verification is reported independently. Calling
`lscli` without a subcommand returns 3 with diagnostic guidance on standard error.
Invalid arguments return argparse's status 2. Doctor text or JSON goes to standard
output. None of these commands loads provider/SDK modules, discovers credentials,
makes provider calls, or creates configuration or state directories.

The JSON diagnostic is versioned with `schema_version: 1`. It includes `product`,
`application`, `framework_version`, `status`, `sdk_payload`,
`execution_available`, `locations`, and `issues`. Payload status is `verified`,
`missing`, or `invalid`. Verification inspects the installed private payload's
manifest and files without importing them. Source/editable development has no
installed private payload and never falls back to the canonical vendor tree.
A missing or damaged payload calls for a verified framework wheel installation.
Diagnostic integrity evidence is not artifact authentication.

## State locations

The new CLI follows the existing global framework home under the user's home:

| Purpose | Path relative to the user home |
| --- | --- |
| Durable CLI state and future sessions | `.local/share/localsetup/state/lscli` |
| Explicit provider profile configuration | `.local/share/localsetup/config/lscli/profiles.json` |
| Managed release runtimes | `.local/share/localsetup/runtimes/lscli` |

Diagnostics only reports these locations. Offline setup and runtime-use leases
are implemented as described below. Profile creation, session persistence,
sandbox protection, worker supervision, PATH collision handling, and agent
dispatch remain subsequent gates. A reported location does not enable them.
Existing framework state, adapter ownership, and stored heartbeat identifiers
are unchanged. See [SDK source and dependency maintenance](SDK_FORK.md) for the
private payload, dependency lock, build, and artifact boundaries.

## Candidate verification

A Python 3.12/Linux wheel installation was checked outside the source checkout.
Its installed `lscli` command returned help and version successfully; doctor
reported `sdk_payload: verified` and `execution_available: false` with exit 3.
The check used a nonexistent temporary user home and confirmed that no home or
state directories were created. A separate isolated Python invocation confirmed
the installed module origin and absence of SDK, provider, HTTP, and YAML imports.
This evidence qualifies the provider-free bootstrap only.

## Runtime lease foundation

The internal `runtime_use` context manager provides shared use leases and
exclusive upgrade leases over one persistent lock inode in the managed runtime
root. Shared leases coexist; an exclusive lease waits for all users. Waits use a
finite, nonnegative monotonic timeout and raise `TimeoutError` on contention.
Process exit and exceptions release the lease. The lock file is never unlinked
or replaced during normal use, preventing separate lock generations.

The runtime root must already exist, be owned by the current user, and deny
writes to other users. Descriptor-relative traversal rejects symlink components;
the lock must be a private regular file with one hard link. The implementation
requires a qualified POSIX `flock` backend. It does not create runtime directories
or change their permissions. This advisory lock coordinates cooperating callers;
the sandbox must separately prevent untrusted same-user processes from writing
the runtime or replacing its root. Do not rename the root while it is leased.

When an operation also needs the existing framework package-root lock, acquire
that lock first, then the runtime lease. Do not convert a shared lease to an
exclusive lease in place. Installation and selection now consume this foundation. Worker lifetime
supervision and platform qualification remain required before execution can be
enabled; doctor continues to report that
execution is unavailable.


## Explicit offline runtime setup

Setup can plan or apply a runtime installation from a specific verified framework
wheel and a local directory containing its audited external artifacts. It does
not select a release from the network, download Python, discover credentials, or
make provider calls. Obtain the expected SHA-256 from the trusted release source;
a hash computed from an untrusted download does not authenticate it.

```bash
lscli setup --plan --wheel /path/to/framework.whl --sha256 EXPECTED_SHA256 --wheelhouse /path/to/dependency-artifacts
lscli setup --apply --wheel /path/to/framework.whl --sha256 EXPECTED_SHA256 --wheelhouse /path/to/dependency-artifacts --timeout 300
```

Replace all placeholders. Both commands emit JSON to stdout and return 0 on
success; setup errors produce diagnostics on stderr and return 2. Keyboard
interruption returns 130 after command teardown. Plan validates
artifact identity, SDK payload, local inputs, and workspace separation without
creating persistent runtime state. The result records the effective workspace,
framework version, artifact digest, runtime root, and release path. The default
root is the managed runtime path above; `--runtime-root` selects an explicit
alternative. The runtime must lie outside the current directory and every
enclosing repository, and cannot contain that workspace. Wheel input is limited
to 256 MiB; ambiguous or oversized distribution metadata is rejected.

Apply acquires an exclusive runtime lease, creates a digest-named release slot,
and writes an incomplete installation record. It creates the environment at its
final path, avoiding virtual-environment relocation. Build and runtime dependencies
come from the wheel's hashed exports and local artifacts only. Build tools are
preloaded; build isolation is disabled so no implicit build dependencies are
resolved. The framework wheel installs without dependency resolution. Dependency
compatibility and installed SDK payload checks must pass before activation.
The managed CLI launcher invokes the absolute installed Python with `-I`,
preventing inherited Python path settings, the working directory, or user site
hooks from selecting checkout code at startup. This rewrites only the framework
CLI launcher; the isolated SDK worker and sandbox still require separate checks.

Only a completed installation replaces `current.json`, using an atomic regular
file replacement and filesystem flushes. The record retains the previous digest,
and prior release directories and sessions remain untouched. Installation
commands share one deadline after preflight, suppress output, and terminate their
process groups on completion or interruption. A failed command reports failure
and retains the incomplete slot for inspection; it does not replay or remove it.
If the process stops near activation, inspect `current.json` and the slot's
`status.json` before deciding what happened. Existing slots are refused, including
completed slots: re-selection/repair and recovery policy remain subsequent gates.
Do not manually edit selection records to bypass validation.

The internal `selected` context holds a shared lease and checks the selected
completion record for the entire caller-owned operation. Runtime installation
and selection are now implemented, but worker supervision, immutable installed
file enforcement, and sandbox protection still need integration. Successful setup
does not enable agent execution or change doctor's unavailable-execution result.
The installer assumes the caller trusts the uv executable and supplied release
digest; artifact authenticity and platform qualification remain external gates.
