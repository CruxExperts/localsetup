# Tmux ops tool: remote

**Purpose:** Use the managed `tmux_ops` workflow when the tmux server runs on a different host than the agent process.

For the local managed workflow, state layout, JSON examples, and agent script, see [tmux-ops-managed.md](tmux-ops-managed.md). This page only explains the remote wrapper behavior.

## Configuration

- `REMOTE_TMUX_HOST` - Hostname or IP of the machine where tmux runs. When set, `ls/tools/tmux_ops` runs the Python tool over SSH on that host and returns the same JSON. Installed packages expose the same entrypoint through the `localsetup://tool/tmux_ops` alias.
- `REMOTE_TMUX_CWD` - Optional repo path on the remote host. Default: `/opt/devzone/devops`.

## Flow

Remote mode changes only the transport location. Before every managed `run`, require either a still-matching verified `ls-workflow-ops-guarded` handoff or a direct `ls-safety-and-backup` record containing the exact command or edit and values, exact remote target, risk classification, likely consequences and affected scope, backup or no-backup decision, rollback action, and the user's immediate explicit approval. `sudo ready` proves only credential readiness. Reject an incomplete, stale, or changed record before sending anything to the remote pane.

Use the same managed commands locally or remotely:

```bash
export REMOTE_TMUX_HOST=sh0t
./ls/tools/tmux_ops pick
./ls/tools/tmux_ops probe -t ops
./ls/tools/tmux_ops run -t ops -- sudo apt update
```

The returned `attach_command`, `state_dir`, `log_path`, and `run_id` all refer to the remote host.
If `probe` or `run` returns `action_required: true`, attach on the remote tmux host with the returned `attach_command`, run `sudo -v` in that exact pane, enter the password, then tell the agent `sudo ready` so it can probe again.

If a run returns `status: "running"`, keep watching by run ID:

```bash
./ls/tools/tmux_ops status -t ops --run-id <run_id> --wait --timeout 120
```

Interrupt only through the managed cancel path:

```bash
./ls/tools/tmux_ops cancel -t ops --run-id <run_id>
```

## Agent rules

- Do not use raw SSH plus tmux commands.
- Do not assume local `/tmp/localsetup-tmux-ops` contains remote status.
- Do not start another `run` while the remote session has an active `run_id`.
- Do not use tmux readiness as authorization; verify the exact approved payload immediately before each `run`.
- If sudo returns `password_required`, ask the user to attach to the remote tmux session and enter the password there.

## When not to set it

If the agent process already runs on the same host as tmux, do not set `REMOTE_TMUX_HOST`. Run `./ls/tools/tmux_ops` directly.
