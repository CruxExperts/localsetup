## Skills and workflow index (in repo)

- **Per platform:** See [PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md](PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md) for context loader and skills paths. Cursor: `.cursor/rules/ls-context-index.md` lists master rule plus key skills and workflow packages.

## Quick reference

- **Run decision tree:** Load workflow package `ls-workflow-spec-clarify-reverse`; see [DECISION_TREE_WORKFLOW.md](DECISION_TREE_WORKFLOW.md).
- **Process queue / PRDs:** Load `ls-workflow-queue-batch-implement`; see [PRD_SCHEMA_EXTERNAL_AGENT_GUIDE.md](PRD_SCHEMA_EXTERNAL_AGENT_GUIDE.md), [WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md](WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md).
- **Agent Q ship/ingest (file_drop or mail):** Load `ls-workflow-transport-handoff` for the orchestration flow and `ls-agentq-transport` for the transport capability; see [AGENTIC_AGENT_Q_SCENARIOS.md](AGENTIC_AGENT_Q_SCENARIOS.md), `ls/tools/agentq_transport_client/docs/USER_GUIDE.md`; mail strict path uses `ls-mail-protocol-control` with `preencrypted_openpgp_armored`.
- **Umbrella workflow:** Load `ls-workflow-umbrella-run`; see [WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md](WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md).
- **Create a new skill:** Load `ls-skill-creator`; see [SKILL_INTEROPERABILITY.md](SKILL_INTEROPERABILITY.md).
- **Create or update a workflow package:** Follow [WORKFLOW_PACKAGES.md](WORKFLOW_PACKAGES.md) and [WORKFLOW_STANDARD.md](WORKFLOW_STANDARD.md); edit `ls/workflows/<package>/workflow.yaml`, then regenerate docs.
- **Import skills from URL or path:** Load `ls-skill-importer`; run `ls/tools/skill_importer_scan <path>`; see [SKILL_IMPORTING.md](SKILL_IMPORTING.md).
- **Discover similar public skills:** Load `ls-skill-discovery` when creating or importing; uses [PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls](PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls) and [PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml](PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml); see [SKILL_DISCOVERY.md](SKILL_DISCOVERY.md).
- **Audit and scrub the public skill index:** Run `uv run --locked python ls/tools/skill_index_scrub.py` to check for dead URLs, stub/placeholder descriptions, and schema gaps. Add `--fix` to fetch real descriptions from upstream and write them back. Add `--report FILE` for a GFM report.
- **Tmux shared session and sudo:** Load workflow package `ls-workflow-ops-tmux-session`; use `ls/tools/tmux_ops` (`pick`, `probe`, `run`, `status`, `cancel`). The workflow package defines the minimal agent script. [ops/tmux-ops-managed.md](ops/tmux-ops-managed.md) explains the implementation, state files, JSON contracts, timeout semantics, and human/operator view. For remote/VMs: see [ops/tmux-ops-remote.md](ops/tmux-ops-remote.md) (`REMOTE_TMUX_HOST`). See [WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md](WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md).
- **Tmux-default terminal mode:** Run `ls/tools/tmux_terminal_mode enable [--mode ide|shell]` to wire up automatic tmux session launch (IDE terminal profile or shell RC auto-attach) and inject the mandatory agent ops rule. `disable` restores originals from backup. `status` reports all layers. See [TMUX_TERMINAL_MODE.md](TMUX_TERMINAL_MODE.md).
- **Run framework audit:** Load `ls-workflow-audit-framework` for the workflow or `ls-framework-audit` for the capability; run from repo root: `python ls/skills/ls-framework-audit/scripts/run_framework_audit.py --output /path/to/report.md` (or set `LOCALSETUP_AUDIT_OUTPUT`). No `--deep` in the current script; if docs elsewhere mention Deep Analysis, treat as backlog until the audit skill ships it. See [WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md](WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md).
- **Run markdown reference audit:** Load `ls-workflow-audit-markdown-references` for the workflow or `ls-markdown-reference-validator` for the capability; run `python ls/skills/ls-markdown-reference-validator/scripts/markdown_reference_audit.py --force --reason manual` (uses YAML sidecar config and writes markdown report). Use this for periodic integrity checks across docs/skills/templates/global Kilo markdown surfaces.
- **Route docs creation and updates:** Load `ls-docs-organization`; see `ls/skills/ls-docs-organization/SKILL.md`. Use it to classify docs, choose folder slugs, and keep indexes aligned.
